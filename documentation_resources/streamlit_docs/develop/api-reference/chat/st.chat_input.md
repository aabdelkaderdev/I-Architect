Read the [Build a basic LLM chat app](/develop/tutorials/llms/build-conversational-apps) tutorial to learn how to use `st.chat_message` and `st.chat_input` to build chat-based apps.

| Function signature[[source]](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.55.0/lib/streamlit/elements/widgets/chat.py#L599 "View st.chat_input source code on GitHub") | |
| --- | --- |
| st.chat\_input(placeholder="Your message", \*, key=None, max\_chars=None, max\_upload\_size=None, accept\_file=False, file\_type=None, accept\_audio=False, audio\_sample\_rate=16000, disabled=False, on\_submit=None, args=None, kwargs=None, width="stretch") | |
| Parameters | |
| placeholder (str) | A placeholder text shown when the chat input is empty. This defaults to "Your message". For accessibility reasons, you should not use an empty string. |
| key (str, int, or None) | An optional string or integer to use as the unique key for the widget. If this is None (default), a key will be generated for the widget based on the values of the other parameters. No two widgets may have the same key. Assigning a key stabilizes the widget's identity and preserves its state across reruns even when other parameters change.  Note  Changing accept\_file, file\_type, max\_chars, or max\_upload\_size resets the widget even when a key is provided.  A key lets you read or update the widget's value via st.session\_state[key]. For more details, see [Widget behavior](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/widget-behavior).  Additionally, if key is provided, it will be used as a CSS class name prefixed with st-key-. |
| max\_chars (int or None) | The maximum number of characters that can be entered. If this is None (default), there will be no maximum. |
| max\_upload\_size (int or None) | The maximum allowed size of each uploaded file in megabytes.  If this is None (default), the maximum file size is set by the server.maxUploadSize configuration option in your config.toml file. If this is an integer, it must be positive and will override the server.maxUploadSize configuration option. |
| accept\_file (bool, "multiple", or "directory") | Whether the chat input should accept files. This can be one of the following values:   - False (default): No files are accepted and the user can only   submit a message. - True: The user can add a single file to their submission. - "multiple": The user can add multiple files to their   submission. - "directory": The user can add multiple files to their   submission by selecting a directory. If file\_type is set,   only files matching those type(s) will be uploaded.   By default, uploaded files are limited to 200 MB each. You can configure this using the server.maxUploadSize config option. For more information on how to set config options, see [config.toml](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/configuration/config.toml). |
| file\_type (str, Sequence[str], or None) | The allowed file extension(s) for uploaded files. This can be one of the following types:   - None (default): All file extensions are allowed. - A string: A single file extension is allowed. For example, to   only accept CSV files, use "csv". - A sequence of strings: Multiple file extensions are allowed. For   example, to only accept JPG/JPEG and PNG files, use   ["jpg", "jpeg", "png"].   Note  This is a best-effort check, but doesn't provide a security guarantee against users uploading files of other types or type extensions. The correct handling of uploaded files is part of the app developer's responsibility. |
| accept\_audio (bool) | Whether to show an audio recording button in the chat input. This defaults to False. If this is True, users can record and submit audio messages. Recorded audio is available as an UploadedFile object with MIME type audio/wav. |
| audio\_sample\_rate (int or None) | The target sample rate for audio recording in Hz when accept\_audio is True. This defaults to 16000, which is optimal for speech recognition.  The following values are supported: 8000 (telephone quality), 11025, 16000 (speech-recognition quality), 22050, 24000, 32000, 44100, 48000 (high-quality), or None. If this is None, the widget uses the browser's default sample rate (typically 44100 or 48000 Hz). |
| disabled (bool) | Whether the chat input should be disabled. This defaults to False. |
| on\_submit (callable) | An optional callback invoked when the chat input's value is submitted. |
| args (list or tuple) | An optional list or tuple of args to pass to the callback. |
| kwargs (dict) | An optional dict of kwargs to pass to the callback. |
| width ("stretch" or int) | The width of the chat input widget. This can be one of the following:   - "stretch" (default): The width of the widget matches the   width of the parent container. - An integer specifying the width in pixels: The widget has a   fixed width. If the specified width is greater than the width of   the parent container, the width of the widget matches the width   of the parent container. |
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Returns | |
| (None, str, or dict-like) | The user's submission. This is one of the following types:   - None: If the user didn't submit a message, file, or audio   recording in the last rerun, the widget returns None. - A string: When the widget isn't configured to accept files or   audio recordings, and the user submitted a message in the last   rerun, the widget returns the user's message as a string. - A dict-like object: When the widget is configured to accept files   or audio recordings, and the user submitted any content in the   last rerun, the widget returns a dict-like object.   The object always includes the text attribute, and   optionally includes files and/or audio attributes depending   on the accept\_file and accept\_audio parameters.   When the widget is configured to accept files or audio recordings, and the user submitted content in the last rerun, you can access the user's submission with key or attribute notation from the dict-like object. This is shown in Example 3 below.   - The text attribute holds a string that is the user's message.   This is an empty string if the user only submitted one or more   files or audio recordings. - The files attribute is only present when accept\_file   isn't False. When present, it holds a list of   UploadedFile objects. The list is empty if the user only   submitted a message or audio recording. Unlike   st.file\_uploader, this attribute always returns a list, even   when the widget is configured to accept only one file at a time. - The audio attribute is only present when accept\_audio is   True. When present, it holds an UploadedFile object if   audio was recorded or None if no audio was recorded.   The UploadedFile class is a subclass of BytesIO and therefore is "file-like". This means you can pass an instance of it anywhere a file is expected. |

#### Examples

**Example 1: Pin the chat input widget to the bottom of your app**

When st.chat\_input is used in the main body of an app, it will be
pinned to the bottom of the page.

```
import streamlit as st

prompt = st.chat_input("Say something")
if prompt:
    st.write(f"User has sent the following prompt: {prompt}")
```

**Example 2: Use the chat input widget inline**

The chat input can also be used inline by nesting it inside any layout
container (container, columns, tabs, sidebar, etc) or fragment. Create
chat interfaces embedded next to other content, or have multiple
chatbots!

```
import streamlit as st

with st.sidebar:
    messages = st.container(height=200)
    if prompt := st.chat_input("Say something"):
        messages.chat_message("user").write(prompt)
        messages.chat_message("assistant").write(f"Echo: {prompt}")
```

**Example 3: Let users upload files**

When you configure your chat input widget to allow file attachments, it
will return a dict-like object when the user sends a submission. You
can access the user's message through the text attribute of this
dictionary. You can access a list of the user's submitted file(s)
through the files attribute. Similar to st.session\_state, you
can use key or attribute notation.

```
import streamlit as st

prompt = st.chat_input(
    "Say something and/or attach an image",
    accept_file=True,
    file_type=["jpg", "jpeg", "png"],
)
if prompt and prompt.text:
    st.markdown(prompt.text)
if prompt and prompt["files"]:
    st.image(prompt["files"][0])
```

**Example 4: Programmatically set the text via session state**

You can use st.session\_state to set the text of the chat input widget.
Because st.chat\_input is a trigger widget, the value in Session State
is cleared after the widget is populated. This prevents the widget from
returning the value until the user submits it.

```
import streamlit as st

if st.button("Set Value"):
    st.session_state.chat_input = "Hello, world!"
st.chat_input(key="chat_input")
st.write("Chat input value:", st.session_state.chat_input)
```

**Example 5: Enable audio recording**

You can enable audio recording by setting accept\_audio=True.
The accept\_audio parameter works independently of accept\_file,
allowing you to enable audio recording with or without file uploads.

```
import streamlit as st

prompt = st.chat_input(
    "Say or record something",
    accept_audio=True,
)
if prompt and prompt.text:
    st.write("Text:", prompt.text)
if prompt and prompt.audio:
    st.audio(prompt.audio)
    st.write("Audio file:", prompt.audio.name)
```
