| Function signature[[source]](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.55.0/lib/streamlit/elements/text.py#L31 "View st.text source code on GitHub") | |
| --- | --- |
| st.text(body, \*, help=None, width="content", text\_alignment="left") | |
| Parameters | |
| body (str) | The string to display. |
| help (str or None) | A tooltip that gets displayed next to the text. If this is None (default), no tooltip is displayed.  The tooltip can optionally contain GitHub-flavored Markdown, including the Markdown directives described in the body parameter of st.markdown. |
| width ("content", "stretch", or int) | The width of the text element. This can be one of the following:   - "content" (default): The width of the element matches the   width of its content, but doesn't exceed the width of the parent   container. - "stretch": The width of the element matches the width of the   parent container. - An integer specifying the width in pixels: The element has a   fixed width. If the specified width is greater than the width of   the parent container, the width of the element matches the width   of the parent container. |
| text\_alignment ("left", "center", "right", or "justify") | The horizontal alignment of the text within the element. This can be one of the following:   - "left" (default): Text is aligned to the left edge. - "center": Text is centered. - "right": Text is aligned to the right edge. - "justify": Text is justified (stretched to fill the available   width with the last line left-aligned).   Note  For text alignment to have a visible effect, the element's width must be wider than its content. If you use width="content" with short text, the alignment may not be noticeable. |

#### Example

```
import streamlit as st

st.text("This is text\n[and more text](that's not a Markdown link).")
