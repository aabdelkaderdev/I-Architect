| Function signature[[source]](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.55.0/lib/streamlit/elements/vega_charts.py#L915 "View st.area_chart source code on GitHub") | |
| --- | --- |
| st.area\_chart(data=None, \*, x=None, y=None, x\_label=None, y\_label=None, color=None, stack=None, width="stretch", height="content", use\_container\_width=None) | |
| Parameters | |
| data (Anything supported by st.dataframe) | Data to be plotted. |
| x (str or None) | Column name or key associated to the x-axis data. If x is None (default), Streamlit uses the data index for the x-axis values. |
| y (str, Sequence of str, or None) | Column name(s) or key(s) associated to the y-axis data. If this is None (default), Streamlit draws the data of all remaining columns as data series. If this is a Sequence of strings, Streamlit draws several series on the same chart by melting your wide-format table into a long-format table behind the scenes. |
| x\_label (str or None) | The label for the x-axis. If this is None (default), Streamlit will use the column name specified in x if available, or else no label will be displayed. |
| y\_label (str or None) | The label for the y-axis. If this is None (default), Streamlit will use the column name(s) specified in y if available, or else no label will be displayed. |
| color (str, tuple, Sequence of str, Sequence of tuple, or None) | The color to use for different series in this chart.  For an area chart with just 1 series, this can be:   - None, to use the default color. - A hex string like "#ffaa00" or "#ffaa0088". - An RGB or RGBA tuple with the red, green, blue, and alpha   components specified as ints from 0 to 255 or floats from 0.0 to   1.0. - A built-in color name: "red", "orange", "yellow", "green",   "blue", "violet", "gray"/"grey", or "primary". These map to   theme colors that you can customize using theme.<color>Color   configuration options.   For an area chart with multiple series, where the dataframe is in long format (that is, y is None or just one column), this can be:   - None, to use the default colors. - The name of a column in the dataset. Data points will be grouped   into series of the same color based on the value of this column.   In addition, if the values in this column match one of the color   formats above (hex string or color tuple), then that color will   be used.  For example: if the dataset has 1000 rows, but this column only   contains the values "adult", "child", and "baby", then those 1000   datapoints will be grouped into three series whose colors will be   automatically selected from the default palette.  But, if for the same 1000-row dataset, this column contained   the values "#ffaa00", "#f0f", "#0000ff", then then those 1000   datapoints would still be grouped into 3 series, but their   colors would be "#ffaa00", "#f0f", "#0000ff" this time around.   For an area chart with multiple series, where the dataframe is in wide format (that is, y is a Sequence of columns), this can be:   - None, to use the default colors. - A list of string colors or color tuples to be used for each of   the series in the chart. This list should have the same length   as the number of y values (e.g. color=["#fd0", "#f0f", "#04f"]   for three lines). You can also use built-in color names in the   list (e.g. color=["red", "blue", "green"]).   You can set the default colors in the theme.chartCategoryColors configuration option. |
| stack (bool, "normalize", "center", or None) | Whether to stack the areas. If this is None (default), Streamlit uses Vega's default. Other values can be as follows:   - True: The areas form a non-overlapping, additive stack within   the chart. - False: The areas overlap each other without stacking. - "normalize": The areas are stacked and the total height is   normalized to 100% of the height of the chart. - "center": The areas are stacked and shifted to center their   baseline, which creates a steamgraph. |
| width ("stretch", "content", or int) | The width of the chart element. This can be one of the following:   - "stretch" (default): The width of the element matches the   width of the parent container. - "content": The width of the element matches the width of its   content, but doesn't exceed the width of the parent container. - An integer specifying the width in pixels: The element has a   fixed width. If the specified width is greater than the width of   the parent container, the width of the element matches the width   of the parent container. |
| height ("stretch", "content", or int) | The height of the chart element. This can be one of the following:   - "content" (default): The height of the element matches the   height of its content. - "stretch": The height of the element matches the height of   its content or the height of the parent container, whichever is   larger. If the element is not in a parent container, the height   of the element matches the height of its content. - An integer specifying the height in pixels: The element has a   fixed height. If the content is larger than the specified   height, scrolling is enabled. |
| use\_container\_width (bool or None) | *delete* use\_container\_width is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. For use\_container\_width=True, use width="stretch".  Whether to override the chart's native width with the width of the parent container. This can be one of the following:   - None (default): Streamlit will use the chart's default behavior. - True: Streamlit sets the width of the chart to match the   width of the parent container. - False: Streamlit sets the width of the chart to fit its   contents according to the plotting library, up to the width of   the parent container. |

#### Examples

**Example 1: Basic area chart from a dataframe**

If you don't use any of the optional parameters, Streamlit plots each
column as a separate area, uses the index as the x values, and labels
each series with the column name:

```
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st
from numpy.random import default_rng as rng

df = pd.DataFrame(rng(0).standard_normal((20, 3)), columns=["a", "b", "c"])

st.area_chart(df)
```

**Example 2: Area chart from specific dataframe columns**

You can choose different columns to use for the x and y values. If your
dataframe is in long format (all y-values in one column), you can set
the area colors from another column.

If the column contains color strings, the colors will be applied
directly and the series will be unlabeled. If the column contains other
values, those values will label each area, and the area colors will be
selected from the default color palette. You can configure this color
palette in the theme.chartCategoryColors configuration option.

```
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st
from numpy.random import default_rng as rng

df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "col1": list(range(20)) * 3,
        "col2": rng(0).standard_normal(60),
        "col3": ["a"] * 20 + ["b"] * 20 + ["c"] * 20,
    }
)

st.area_chart(df, x="col1", y="col2", color="col3")
```

**Example 3: Area chart from wide-format dataframe**

If your dataframe is in wide format (y-values are in multiple columns),
you can pass a list of columns to the y parameter. Each column
name becomes a series label. To override the default colors, pass a
list of colors to the color parameter, one for each series. If your
areas are overlapping, use colors with some transparency (alpha
channel) for the best results.

```
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st
from numpy.random import default_rng as rng

df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "col1": list(range(20)),
        "col2": rng(0).standard_normal(20),
        "col3": rng(1).standard_normal(20),
    }
)

st.area_chart(
    df,
    x="col1",
    y=["col2", "col3"],
    color=["#FF000080", "#0000FF80"],
)
```

**Example 4: Area chart with different stacking**

You can adjust the stacking behavior by setting stack. You can
create a streamgraph by setting stack="center":

```
import streamlit as st
from vega_datasets import data

df = data.unemployment_across_industries()

st.area_chart(df, x="date", y="count", color="series", stack="center")
```

| Function signature[[source]](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.55.0/lib/streamlit/elements/arrow.py#L809 "View st.add_rows source code on GitHub") | |
| --- | --- |
| element.add\_rows(data=None, \*\*kwargs) | |
| Parameters | |
| data (pandas.DataFrame, pandas.Styler, pyarrow.Table, numpy.ndarray, pyspark.sql.DataFrame, snowflake.snowpark.dataframe.DataFrame, Iterable, dict, or None) | Table to concat. Optional. |
| \*\*kwargs (pandas.DataFrame, numpy.ndarray, Iterable, dict, or None) | The named dataset to concat. Optional. You can only pass in 1 dataset (including the one in the data parameter). |

#### Example

```
import time
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st
from numpy.random import default_rng as rng

df1 = pd.DataFrame(
    rng(0).standard_normal(size=(50, 20)), columns=("col %d" % i for i in range(20))
)

df2 = pd.DataFrame(
    rng(1).standard_normal(size=(50, 20)), columns=("col %d" % i for i in range(20))
)

my_table = st.table(df1)
time.sleep(1)
my_table.add_rows(df2)
```

You can do the same thing with plots. For example, if you want to add
more data to a line chart:

```
# Assuming df1 and df2 from the example above still exist...
my_chart = st.line_chart(df1)
time.sleep(1)
my_chart.add_rows(df2)
```

And for plots whose datasets are named, you can pass the data with a
keyword argument where the key is the name:

```
my_chart = st.vega_lite_chart(
    {
        "mark": "line",
        "encoding": {"x": "a", "y": "b"},
        "datasets": {
            "some_fancy_name": df1,  # <-- named dataset
        },
        "data": {"name": "some_fancy_name"},
    }
)
my_chart.add_rows(some_fancy_name=df2)  # <-- name used as keyword
```
