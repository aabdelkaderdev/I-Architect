| Function signature[[source]](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.55.0/lib/streamlit/elements/plotly_chart.py#L415 "View st.plotly_chart source code on GitHub") | |
| --- | --- |
| st.plotly\_chart(figure\_or\_data, use\_container\_width=None, \*, width="stretch", height="content", theme="streamlit", key=None, on\_select="ignore", selection\_mode=('points', 'box', 'lasso'), config=None, \*\*kwargs) | |
| Parameters | |
| figure\_or\_data (plotly.graph\_objs.Figure, plotly.graph\_objs.Data, or dict/list of plotly.graph\_objs.Figure/Data) | The Plotly Figure or Data object to render. See <https://plot.ly/python/> for examples of graph descriptions.  Note  If your chart contains more than 1000 data points, Plotly will use a WebGL renderer to display the chart. Different browsers have different limits on the number of WebGL contexts per page. If you have multiple WebGL contexts on a page, you may need to switch to SVG rendering mode. You can do this by setting render\_mode="svg" within the figure. For example, the following code defines a Plotly Express line chart that will render in SVG mode when passed to st.plotly\_chart: px.line(df, x="x", y="y", render\_mode="svg"). |
| width ("stretch", "content", or int) | The width of the chart element. This can be one of the following:   - "stretch" (default): The width of the element matches the   width of the parent container. - "content": The width of the element matches the width of its   content, but doesn't exceed the width of the parent container. - An integer specifying the width in pixels: The element has a   fixed width. If the specified width is greater than the width of   the parent container, the width of the element matches the width   of the parent container. |
| height ("content", "stretch", or int) | The height of the chart element. This can be one of the following:   - "content" (default): The height of the element matches the   height of its content. - "stretch": The height of the element matches the height of   its content or the height of the parent container, whichever is   larger. If the element is not in a parent container, the height   of the element matches the height of its content. - An integer specifying the height in pixels: The element has a   fixed height. If the content is larger than the specified   height, scrolling is enabled. |
| use\_container\_width (bool or None) | *delete* use\_container\_width is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. For use\_container\_width=True, use width="stretch".  Whether to override the figure's native width with the width of the parent container. This can be one of the following:   - None (default): Streamlit will use the value of width. - True: Streamlit sets the width of the figure to match the   width of the parent container. - False: Streamlit sets the width of the figure to fit its   contents according to the plotting library, up to the width of   the parent container. |
| theme ("streamlit" or None) | The theme of the chart. If theme is "streamlit" (default), Streamlit uses its own design default. If theme is None, Streamlit falls back to the default behavior of the library.  The "streamlit" theme can be partially customized through the configuration options theme.chartCategoricalColors and theme.chartSequentialColors. Font configuration options are also applied. |
| key (str, int, or None) | An optional string to use for giving this element a stable identity. If this is None (default), the element's identity will be determined based on the values of the other parameters.  If selections are activated and key is provided, Streamlit will register the key in Session State to store the selection state. The selection state is read-only. For more details, see [Widget behavior](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/widget-behavior).  Additionally, if key is provided, it will be used as a CSS class name prefixed with st-key-. |
| on\_select ("ignore" or "rerun" or callable) | How the figure should respond to user selection events. This controls whether or not the figure behaves like an input widget. on\_select can be one of the following:   - "ignore" (default): Streamlit will not react to any selection   events in the chart. The figure will not behave like an input   widget. - "rerun": Streamlit will rerun the app when the user selects   data in the chart. In this case, st.plotly\_chart will return   the selection data as a dictionary. - A callable: Streamlit will rerun the app and execute the   callable as a callback function before the rest of the app.   In this case, st.plotly\_chart will return the selection data   as a dictionary. |
| selection\_mode ("points", "box", "lasso" or an Iterable of these) | The selection mode of the chart. This can be one of the following:   - "points": The chart will allow selections based on individual   data points. - "box": The chart will allow selections based on rectangular   areas. - "lasso": The chart will allow selections based on freeform   areas. - An Iterable of the above options: The chart will allow   selections based on the modes specified.   All selections modes are activated by default. |
| config (dict or None) | A dictionary of Plotly configuration options. This is passed to Plotly's show() function. For more information about Plotly configuration options, see Plotly's documentation on [Configuration in Python](https://plotly.com/python/configuration-options/). |
| \*\*kwargs (null) | *delete* \*\*kwargs are deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use config instead.  Additional arguments accepted by Plotly's plot() function.  This supports config, a dictionary of Plotly configuration options. For more information about Plotly configuration options, see Plotly's documentation on [Configuration in Python](https://plotly.com/python/configuration-options/). |
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Returns | |
| (element or dict) | If on\_select is "ignore" (default), this command returns an internal placeholder for the chart element. Otherwise, this command returns a dictionary-like object that supports both key and attribute notation. The attributes are described by the PlotlyState dictionary schema. |

#### Examples

**Example 1: Basic Plotly chart**

The example below comes from the examples at <https://plot.ly/python>.
Note that plotly.figure\_factory requires scipy to run.

```
import plotly.figure_factory as ff
import streamlit as st
from numpy.random import default_rng as rng

hist_data = [
    rng(0).standard_normal(200) - 2,
    rng(1).standard_normal(200),
    rng(2).standard_normal(200) + 2,
]
group_labels = ["Group 1", "Group 2", "Group 3"]

fig = ff.create_distplot(
    hist_data, group_labels, bin_size=[0.1, 0.25, 0.5]
)

st.plotly_chart(fig)
```

**Example 2: Plotly Chart with configuration**

By default, Plotly charts have scroll zoom enabled. If you have a
longer page and want to avoid conflicts between page scrolling and
zooming, you can use Plotly's configuration options to disable scroll
zoom. In the following example, scroll zoom is disabled, but the zoom
buttons are still enabled in the modebar.

```
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import streamlit as st

fig = go.Figure()
fig.add_trace(
    go.Scatter(
        x=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
        y=[1, 3, 2, 5, 4]
    )
)

st.plotly_chart(fig, config = {'scrollZoom': False})
```

| Attributes | |
| selection (dict) | The state of the on\_select event. This attribute returns a dictionary-like object that supports both key and attribute notation. The attributes are described by the PlotlySelectionState dictionary schema. |

#### Example

Try selecting points by any of the three available methods (direct click,
box, or lasso). The current selection state is available through Session
State or as the output of the chart function.

```
import plotly.express as px
import streamlit as st

df = px.data.iris()
fig = px.scatter(df, x="sepal_width", y="sepal_length")

event = st.plotly_chart(fig, key="iris", on_select="rerun")

event
```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Attributes | |
| points (list[dict[str, Any]]) | The selected data points in the chart, including the data points selected by the box and lasso mode. The data includes the values associated to each point and a point index used to populate point\_indices. If additional information has been assigned to your points, such as size or legend group, this is also included. |
| point\_indices (list[int]) | The numerical indices of all selected data points in the chart. The details of each identified point are included in points. |
| box (list[dict[str, Any]]) | The metadata related to the box selection. This includes the coordinates of the selected area. |
| lasso (list[dict[str, Any]]) | The metadata related to the lasso selection. This includes the coordinates of the selected area. |

#### Example

When working with more complicated graphs, the points attribute
displays additional information. Try selecting points in the following
example:

```
import plotly.express as px
import streamlit as st

df = px.data.iris()
fig = px.scatter(
    df,
    x="sepal_width",
    y="sepal_length",
    color="species",
    size="petal_length",
    hover_data=["petal_width"],
)

event = st.plotly_chart(fig, key="iris", on_select="rerun")

event.selection
```

[Built with Streamlit 🎈](https://streamlit.io)

[Fullscreen *open\_in\_new*](https://doc-chart-events-plotly-selection-state.streamlit.app//?utm_medium=oembed&)

This is an example of the selection state when selecting a single point:

```
{
  "points": [
    {
      "curve_number": 2,
      "point_number": 9,
      "point_index": 9,
      "x": 3.6,
      "y": 7.2,
      "customdata": [
        2.5
      ],
      "marker_size": 6.1,
      "legendgroup": "virginica"
    }
  ],
  "point_indices": [
    9
  ],
  "box": [],
  "lasso": []
}
```

Plotly charts are displayed using the Streamlit theme by default. This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.

The Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme="streamlit"` keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, use `theme=None` instead.

Let's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Plotly theme:

```
import plotly.express as px
import streamlit as st

df = px.data.gapminder()

fig = px.scatter(
    df.query("year==2007"),
    x="gdpPercap",
    y="lifeExp",
    size="pop",
    color="continent",
    hover_name="country",
    log_x=True,
    size_max=60,
)

tab1, tab2 = st.tabs(["Streamlit theme (default)", "Plotly native theme"])
with tab1:
    # Use the Streamlit theme.
    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.
    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme="streamlit", use_container_width=True)
with tab2:
    # Use the native Plotly theme.
    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True)
```

Click the tabs in the interactive app below to see the charts with the Streamlit theme enabled and disabled.

If you're wondering if your own customizations will still be taken into account, don't worry! You can still make changes to your chart configurations. In other words, although we now enable the Streamlit theme by default, you can overwrite it with custom colors or fonts. For example, if you want a chart line to be green instead of the default red, you can do it!

Here's an example of an Plotly chart where a custom color scale is defined and reflected:

```
import plotly.express as px
import streamlit as st

st.subheader("Define a custom colorscale")
df = px.data.iris()
fig = px.scatter(
    df,
    x="sepal_width",
    y="sepal_length",
    color="sepal_length",
    color_continuous_scale="reds",
)

tab1, tab2 = st.tabs(["Streamlit theme (default)", "Plotly native theme"])
with tab1:
    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme="streamlit", use_container_width=True)
with tab2:
    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True)
```

Notice how the custom color scale is still reflected in the chart, even when the Streamlit theme is enabled 👇
