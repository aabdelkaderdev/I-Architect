| Function signature[[source]](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.55.0/lib/streamlit/elements/graphviz_chart.py#L49 "View st.graphviz_chart source code on GitHub") | |
| --- | --- |
| st.graphviz\_chart(figure\_or\_dot, use\_container\_width=None, \*, width="content", height="content") | |
| Parameters | |
| figure\_or\_dot (graphviz.dot.Graph, graphviz.dot.Digraph, graphviz.sources.Source, str) | The Graphlib graph object or dot string to display |
| use\_container\_width (bool) | *delete* use\_container\_width is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. For use\_container\_width=True, use width="stretch". For use\_container\_width=False, use width="content".  Whether to override the figure's native width with the width of the parent container. If use\_container\_width is False (default), Streamlit sets the width of the chart to fit its contents according to the plotting library, up to the width of the parent container. If use\_container\_width is True, Streamlit sets the width of the figure to match the width of the parent container. |
| width ("content", "stretch", or int) | The width of the chart element. This can be one of the following:   - "content" (default): The width of the element matches the   width of its content, but doesn't exceed the width of the parent   container. - "stretch": The width of the element matches the width of the   parent container. - An integer specifying the width in pixels: The element has a   fixed width. If the specified width is greater than the width of   the parent container, the width of the element matches the width   of the parent container. |
| height ("content", "stretch", or int) | The height of the chart element. This can be one of the following:   - "content" (default): The height of the element matches the   height of its content. - "stretch": The height of the element matches the height of   its content or the height of the parent container, whichever is   larger. If the element is not in a parent container, the height   of the element matches the height of its content. - An integer specifying the height in pixels: The element has a   fixed height. If the content is larger than the specified   height, scrolling is enabled. |

#### Example

```
import streamlit as st
import graphviz

# Create a graphlib graph object
graph = graphviz.Digraph()
graph.edge("run", "intr")
graph.edge("intr", "runbl")
graph.edge("runbl", "run")
graph.edge("run", "kernel")
graph.edge("kernel", "zombie")
graph.edge("kernel", "sleep")
graph.edge("kernel", "runmem")
graph.edge("sleep", "swap")
graph.edge("swap", "runswap")
graph.edge("runswap", "new")
graph.edge("runswap", "runmem")
graph.edge("new", "runmem")
graph.edge("sleep", "runmem")

st.graphviz_chart(graph)
```

Or you can render the chart from the graph using GraphViz's Dot
language:

```
st.graphviz_chart('''
    digraph {
        run -> intr
        intr -> runbl
        runbl -> run
        run -> kernel
        kernel -> zombie
        kernel -> sleep
        kernel -> runmem
        sleep -> swap
        swap -> runswap
        runswap -> new
        runswap -> runmem
        new -> runmem
        sleep -> runmem
    }
''')
```
