| Function signature[[source]](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.55.0/lib/streamlit/elements/widgets/button.py#L395 "View st.download_button source code on GitHub") | |
| --- | --- |
| st.download\_button(label, data, file\_name=None, mime=None, key=None, help=None, on\_click="rerun", args=None, kwargs=None, \*, type="secondary", icon=None, icon\_position="left", disabled=False, use\_container\_width=None, width="content", shortcut=None) | |
| Parameters | |
| label (str) | A short label explaining to the user what this button is for. The label can optionally contain GitHub-flavored Markdown of the following types: Bold, Italics, Strikethroughs, Inline Code, Links, and Images. Images display like icons, with a max height equal to the font height.  Unsupported Markdown elements are unwrapped so only their children (text contents) render. Common block-level Markdown (headings, lists, blockquotes) is automatically escaped and displays as literal text in labels.  See the body parameter of [st.markdown](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/text/st.markdown) for additional, supported Markdown directives. |
| data (str, bytes, file-like, or callable) | The contents of the file to be downloaded or a callable that returns the contents of the file.  File contents can be a string, bytes, or file-like object. File-like objects include io.BytesIO, io.StringIO, or any class that implements the abstract base class io.RawIOBase.  If a callable is passed, it is executed when the user clicks the download button and runs on a separate thread from the resulting script rerun. This deferred generation is helpful for large files to avoid blocking the page script. The callable can't accept any arguments. If any Streamlit commands are executed inside the callable, they will be ignored.  To prevent unnecessary recomputation, use caching when converting your data for download. For more information, see the Example 1 below. |
| file\_name (str) | An optional string to use as the name of the file to be downloaded, such as "my\_file.csv". If not specified, the name will be automatically generated. |
| mime (str or None) | The MIME type of the data. If this is None (default), Streamlit sets the MIME type depending on the value of data as follows:   - If data is a string or textual file (i.e. str or   io.TextIOWrapper object), Streamlit uses the "text/plain"   MIME type. - If data is a binary file or bytes (i.e. bytes,   io.BytesIO, io.BufferedReader, or io.RawIOBase   object), Streamlit uses the "application/octet-stream" MIME type.   For more information about MIME types, see <https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml>. |
| key (str, int, or None) | An optional string or integer to use as the unique key for the widget. If this is None (default), a key will be generated for the widget based on the values of the other parameters. No two widgets may have the same key. Assigning a key stabilizes the widget's identity and preserves its state across reruns even when other parameters change.  A key lets you access the widget's value via st.session\_state[key] (read-only). For more details, see [Widget behavior](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/widget-behavior).  Additionally, if key is provided, it will be used as a CSS class name prefixed with st-key-. |
| help (str or None) | A tooltip that gets displayed when the button is hovered over. If this is None (default), no tooltip is displayed.  The tooltip can optionally contain GitHub-flavored Markdown, including the Markdown directives described in the body parameter of st.markdown. |
| on\_click (callable, "rerun", "ignore", or None) | How the button should respond to user interaction. This controls whether or not the button triggers a rerun and if a callback function is called. This can be one of the following values:   - "rerun" (default): The user downloads the file and the app   reruns. No callback function is called. - "ignore": The user downloads the file and the app doesn't   rerun. No callback function is called. - A callable: The user downloads the file and app reruns. The   callable is called before the rest of the app. - None: This is same as on\_click="rerun". This value exists   for backwards compatibility and shouldn't be used. |
| args (list or tuple) | An optional list or tuple of args to pass to the callback. |
| kwargs (dict) | An optional dict of kwargs to pass to the callback. |
| type ("primary", "secondary", or "tertiary") | An optional string that specifies the button type. This can be one of the following:   - "primary": The button's background is the app's primary color   for additional emphasis. - "secondary" (default): The button's background coordinates   with the app's background color for normal emphasis. - "tertiary": The button is plain text without a border or   background for subtlety. |
| icon (str or None) | An optional emoji or icon to display next to the button label. If icon is None (default), no icon is displayed. If icon is a string, the following options are valid:   - A single-character emoji. For example, you can set icon="🚨"   or icon="🔥". Emoji short codes are not supported. - An icon from the Material Symbols library (rounded style) in the   format ":material/icon\_name:" where "icon\_name" is the name   of the icon in snake case.  For example, icon=":material/thumb\_up:" will display the   Thumb Up icon. Find additional icons in the [Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Symbols&icon.style=Rounded)    font library. - "spinner": Displays a spinner as an icon. |
| icon\_position ("left" or "right") | The position of the icon relative to the button label. This defaults to "left". |
| disabled (bool) | An optional boolean that disables the download button if set to True. The default is False. |
| use\_container\_width (bool) | *delete* use\_container\_width is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. For use\_container\_width=True, use width="stretch". For use\_container\_width=False, use width="content".  Whether to expand the button's width to fill its parent container. If use\_container\_width is False (default), Streamlit sizes the button to fit its contents. If use\_container\_width is True, the width of the button matches its parent container.  In both cases, if the contents of the button are wider than the parent container, the contents will line wrap. |
| width ("content", "stretch", or int) | The width of the download button. This can be one of the following:   - "content" (default): The width of the button matches the   width of its content, but doesn't exceed the width of the parent   container. - "stretch": The width of the button matches the width of the   parent container. - An integer specifying the width in pixels: The button has a   fixed width. If the specified width is greater than the width of   the parent container, the width of the button matches the width   of the parent container. |
| shortcut (str or None) | An optional keyboard shortcut that triggers the button. This can be one of the following strings:   - A single alphanumeric key like "K" or "4". - A function key like "F11". - A special key like "Enter", "Esc", or "Tab". - Any of the above combined with modifiers. For example, you can use   "Ctrl+K" or "Cmd+Shift+O".   Important  The keys "C" and "R" are reserved and can't be used, even with modifiers. Punctuation keys like "." and "," aren't currently supported.  For a list of supported keys and modifiers, see the documentation for [st.button](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/widgets/st.button). |
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Returns | |
| (bool) | True if the button was clicked on the last run of the app, False otherwise. |

#### Examples

**Example 1: Download a dataframe as a CSV file**

When working with a large dataframe, it's recommended to fetch your
data with a cached function. When working with a download button, it's
similarly recommended to convert your data into a downloadable format
with a cached function. Caching ensures that the app reruns
efficiently.

```
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

@st.cache_data
def get_data():
    df = pd.DataFrame(
        np.random.randn(50, 20), columns=("col %d" % i for i in range(20))
    )
    return df

@st.cache_data
def convert_for_download(df):
    return df.to_csv().encode("utf-8")

df = get_data()
csv = convert_for_download(df)

st.download_button(
    label="Download CSV",
    data=csv,
    file_name="data.csv",
    mime="text/csv",
    icon=":material/download:",
)
```

**Example 2: Download a string as a text file**

If you pass a string to the data argument, Streamlit will
automatically use the "text/plain" MIME type.

When you have a widget (like a text area) affecting the value of your
download, it's recommended to use another button to prepare the
download. In this case, use on\_click="ignore" in your download
button to prevent the download button from rerunning your app. This
turns the download button into a frontend-only element that can be
nested in another button.

Without a preparation button, a user can type something into the text
area and immediately click the download button. Because a download is
initiated concurrently with the app rerun, this can create a race-like
condition where the user doesn't see the updated data in their
download.

Important

Even when you prevent your download button from triggering a rerun,
another widget with a pending change can still trigger a rerun. For
example, if a text area has a pending change when a user clicks a
download button, the text area will trigger a rerun.

```
import streamlit as st

message = st.text_area("Message", value="Lorem ipsum.\nStreamlit is cool.")

if st.button("Prepare download"):
    st.download_button(
        label="Download text",
        data=message,
        file_name="message.txt",
        on_click="ignore",
        type="primary",
        icon=":material/download:",
    )
```

**Example 3: Download a file**

Use a context manager to open and read a local file on your Streamlit
server. Pass the io.BufferedReader object directly to data.
Remember to specify the MIME type if you don't want the default
type of "application/octet-stream" for generic binary data. In the
example below, the MIME type is set to "image/png" for a PNG file.

```
import streamlit as st

with open("flower.png", "rb") as file:
    st.download_button(
        label="Download image",
        data=file,
        file_name="flower.png",
        mime="image/png",
    )
```

**Example 4: Generate the data on-click with a callable**

Pass a callable to data to generate the bytes lazily when the user
clicks the button. Streamlit commands inside this callable are ignored.
The callable can't accept any arguments and must return a file-like
object.

```
import streamlit as st
import time

def make_report():
    time.sleep(1)
    return "col1,col2\n1,2\n3,4".encode("utf-8")

st.download_button(
    label="Download report",
    data=make_report,
    file_name="report.csv",
    mime="text/csv",
)
```
