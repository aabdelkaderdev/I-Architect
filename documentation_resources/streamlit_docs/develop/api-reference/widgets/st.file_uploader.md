| Function signature[[source]](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.55.0/lib/streamlit/elements/widgets/file_uploader.py#L251 "View st.file_uploader source code on GitHub") | |
| --- | --- |
| st.file\_uploader(label, type=None, accept\_multiple\_files=False, key=None, help=None, on\_change=None, args=None, kwargs=None, \*, max\_upload\_size=None, disabled=False, label\_visibility="visible", width="stretch") | |
| Parameters | |
| label (str) | A short label explaining to the user what this file uploader is for. The label can optionally contain GitHub-flavored Markdown of the following types: Bold, Italics, Strikethroughs, Inline Code, Links, and Images. Images display like icons, with a max height equal to the font height.  Unsupported Markdown elements are unwrapped so only their children (text contents) render. Common block-level Markdown (headings, lists, blockquotes) is automatically escaped and displays as literal text in labels.  See the body parameter of [st.markdown](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/text/st.markdown) for additional, supported Markdown directives.  For accessibility reasons, you should never set an empty label, but you can hide it with label\_visibility if needed. In the future, we may disallow empty labels by raising an exception. |
| type (str, list of str, or None) | The allowed file extension(s) for uploaded files. This can be one of the following types:   - None (default): All file extensions are allowed. - A string: A single file extension is allowed. For example, to   only accept CSV files, use "csv". - A sequence of strings: Multiple file extensions are allowed. For   example, to only accept JPG/JPEG and PNG files, use   ["jpg", "jpeg", "png"].   Note  This is a best-effort check, but doesn't provide a security guarantee against users uploading files of other types or type extensions. The correct handling of uploaded files is part of the app developer's responsibility. |
| max\_upload\_size (int or None) | The maximum allowed size of each uploaded file in megabytes.  If this is None (default), the maximum file size is set by the server.maxUploadSize configuration option in your config.toml file. If this is an integer, it must be positive and will override the server.maxUploadSize configuration option. |
| accept\_multiple\_files (bool or "directory") | Whether to accept more than one file in a submission. This can be one of the following values:   - False (default): The user can only submit one file at a time. - True: The user can upload multiple files at the same time. - "directory": The user can select a directory to upload all   files in the directory and its subdirectories. If type is   set, only files matching those type(s) will be uploaded.   When this is True or "directory", the return value will be a list and a user can additively select files if they click the browse button on the widget multiple times. |
| key (str, int, or None) | An optional string or integer to use as the unique key for the widget. If this is None (default), a key will be generated for the widget based on the values of the other parameters. No two widgets may have the same key. Assigning a key stabilizes the widget's identity and preserves its state across reruns even when other parameters change.  Note  Changing type, accept\_multiple\_files, or max\_upload\_size resets the widget even when a key is provided.  A key lets you access the widget's value via st.session\_state[key] (read-only). For more details, see [Widget behavior](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/widget-behavior).  Additionally, if key is provided, it will be used as a CSS class name prefixed with st-key-. |
| help (str or None) | A tooltip that gets displayed next to the widget label. Streamlit only displays the tooltip when label\_visibility="visible". If this is None (default), no tooltip is displayed.  The tooltip can optionally contain GitHub-flavored Markdown, including the Markdown directives described in the body parameter of st.markdown. |
| on\_change (callable) | An optional callback invoked when this file\_uploader's value changes. |
| args (list or tuple) | An optional list or tuple of args to pass to the callback. |
| kwargs (dict) | An optional dict of kwargs to pass to the callback. |
| disabled (bool) | An optional boolean that disables the file uploader if set to True. The default is False. |
| label\_visibility ("visible", "hidden", or "collapsed") | The visibility of the label. The default is "visible". If this is "hidden", Streamlit displays an empty spacer instead of the label, which can help keep the widget aligned with other widgets. If this is "collapsed", Streamlit displays no label or spacer. |
| width ("stretch" or int) | The width of the file uploader widget. This can be one of the following:   - "stretch" (default): The width of the widget matches the   width of the parent container. - An integer specifying the width in pixels: The widget has a   fixed width. If the specified width is greater than the width of   the parent container, the width of the widget matches the width   of the parent container. |
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Returns | |
| (None, UploadedFile, or list of UploadedFile) | - If accept\_multiple\_files is False, returns either None or   an UploadedFile object. - If accept\_multiple\_files is True or "directory", returns   a list with the uploaded files as UploadedFile objects. If no   files were uploaded, returns an empty list.   The UploadedFile class is a subclass of BytesIO, and therefore is "file-like". This means you can pass an instance of it anywhere a file is expected. |

#### Examples

**Example 1: Accept a single file at a time**

```
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
from io import StringIO

uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Choose a file")
if uploaded_file is not None:
    # To read file as bytes:
    bytes_data = uploaded_file.getvalue()
    st.write(bytes_data)

    # To convert to a string based IO:
    stringio = StringIO(uploaded_file.getvalue().decode("utf-8"))
    st.write(stringio)

    # To read file as string:
    string_data = stringio.read()
    st.write(string_data)

    # Can be used wherever a "file-like" object is accepted:
    dataframe = pd.read_csv(uploaded_file)
    st.write(dataframe)
```

**Example 2: Accept multiple files at a time**

```
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

uploaded_files = st.file_uploader(
    "Upload data", accept_multiple_files=True, type="csv"
)
for uploaded_file in uploaded_files:
    df = pd.read_csv(uploaded_file)
    st.write(df)
```

**Example 3: Accept an entire directory**

```
import streamlit as st

uploaded_files = st.file_uploader(
    "Upload images", accept_multiple_files="directory", type=["jpg", "png"]
)
for uploaded_file in uploaded_files:
    st.image(uploaded_file)
```
