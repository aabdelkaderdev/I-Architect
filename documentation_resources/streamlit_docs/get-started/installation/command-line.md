This page will walk you through creating an environment with `venv` and installing Streamlit with `pip`. These are our recommended tools, but if you are familiar with others you can use your favorite ones too. At the end, you'll build a simple "Hello world" app and run it. If you prefer to have a graphical interface to manage your Python environments, check out how to [Install Streamlit using Anaconda Distribution](/get-started/installation/anaconda-distribution).

As with any programming tool, in order to install Streamlit you first need to make sure your
computer is properly set up. More specifically, you’ll need:

1. **Python**

   We support [version 3.10 to 3.14](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **A Python environment manager** (recommended)

   Environment managers create virtual environments to isolate Python package installations between
   projects.

   We recommend using virtual environments because installing or upgrading a Python package may
   cause unintentional effects on another package. For a detailed introduction to Python
   environments, check out
   [Python Virtual Environments: A Primer](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/).

   For this guide, we'll be using `venv`, which comes with Python.
3. **A Python package manager**

   Package managers handle installing each of your Python packages, including Streamlit.

   For this guide, we'll be using `pip`, which comes with Python.
4. **Only on MacOS: Xcode command line tools**

   Download Xcode command line tools using [these instructions](https://mac.install.guide/commandlinetools/4.html)
   in order to let the package manager install some of Streamlit's dependencies.
5. **A code editor**

   Our favorite editor is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), which is also what we use in
   all our tutorials.

1. Open a terminal and navigate to your project folder.

   ```
   cd myproject
   ```
2. In your terminal, type:

   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   ```
3. A folder named ".venv" will appear in your project. This directory is where your virtual environment and its dependencies are installed.

4. In your terminal, activate your environment with one of the following commands, depending on your operating system.

   ```
   # Windows command prompt
   .venv\Scripts\activate.bat

   # Windows PowerShell
   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

   # macOS and Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
5. Once activated, you will see your environment name in parentheses before your prompt. "(.venv)"

6. In the terminal with your environment activated, type:

   ```
   pip install streamlit
   ```
7. Test that the installation worked by launching the Streamlit Hello example app:

   ```
   streamlit hello
   ```

   If this doesn't work, use the long-form command:

   ```
   python -m streamlit hello
   ```
8. Streamlit's Hello app should appear in a new tab in your web browser!

9. Close your terminal when you are done.

10. Create a file named `app.py` in your project folder.

```
import streamlit as st

st.write("Hello world")
```

11. Any time you want to use your new environment, you first need to go to your project folder (where the `.venv` directory lives) and run the command to activate it:

```
# Windows command prompt
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Windows PowerShell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# macOS and Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

12. Once activated, you will see your environment's name in parentheses at the beginning of your terminal prompt. "(.venv)"
13. Run your Streamlit app.

```
streamlit run app.py
```

If this doesn't work, use the long-form command:

```
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

14. To stop the Streamlit server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
15. When you're done using this environment, return to your normal shell by typing:

```
deactivate
```
