# Change history for Celery 2.0

## 

release-date:

### 

- Worker: Properly handle connection errors happening while
  closing consumers.
- Worker: Events are now buffered if the connection is down,
  then sent when the connection is re-established.
- No longer depends on the <https://pypi.org/project/mailer/> package.

  > This package had a name space collision with django-mailer,
  > so its functionality was replaced.
- Redis result backend: Documentation typos: Redis doesn’t have
  database names, but database numbers. The default database is now 0.
- `inspect`:
  registered\_tasks was requesting an invalid command because of a typo.

  > See issue #170.
- `CELERY_ROUTES`: Values defined in the route should now have
  precedence over values defined in `CELERY_QUEUES` when merging
  the two.

  > With the follow settings:
  >
  > ```
  > CELERY_QUEUES = {'cpubound': {'exchange': 'cpubound',
  >                               'routing_key': 'cpubound'}}
  >
  > CELERY_ROUTES = {'tasks.add': {'queue': 'cpubound',
  >                                'routing_key': 'tasks.add',
  >                                'serializer': 'json'}}
  > ```
  >
  > The final routing options for tasks.add will become:
  >
  > ```
  > {'exchange': 'cpubound',
  >  'routing_key': 'tasks.add',
  >  'serializer': 'json'}
  > ```
  >
  > This wasn’t the case before: the values
  > in `CELERY_QUEUES` would take precedence.
- Worker crashed if the value of `CELERY_TASK_ERROR_WHITELIST` was
  not an iterable
- `apply()`: Make sure kwargs[‘task\_id’] is
  always set.
- AsyncResult.traceback: Now returns `None`, instead of raising
  [`KeyError`](https://docs.python.org/dev/library/exceptions.html#KeyError "(in Python v3.15)") if traceback is missing.
- `inspect`: Replies didn’t work correctly
  if no destination was specified.
- Can now store result/meta-data for custom states.
- Worker: A warning is now emitted if the sending of task error
  emails fails.
- `celeryev`: Curses monitor no longer crashes if the terminal window
  is resized.

  > See issue #160.
- Worker: On macOS it isn’t possible to run os.exec\* in a process
  that’s threaded.

  > > This breaks the SIGHUP restart handler,
  > > and is now disabled on macOS, emitting a warning instead.
  >
  > See issue #152.
- `celery.execute.trace`: Properly handle raise(str),
  which is still allowed in Python 2.4.

  > See issue #175.
- Using urllib2 in a periodic task on macOS crashed because
  of the proxy auto detection used in macOS.

  > This is now fixed by using a workaround.
  > See issue #143.
- Debian init-scripts: Commands shouldn’t run in a sub shell

  > See issue #163.
- Debian init-scripts: Use the absolute path of `celeryd` program to allow stat

  > See issue #162.

### 

- getting-started/broker-installation: Fixed typo

  > set\_permissions “” -> set\_permissions “.\*”.
- Tasks User Guide: Added section on database transactions.

  > See issue #169.
- Routing User Guide: Fixed typo “feed”: -> {“queue”: “feeds”}.

  > See issue #169.
- Documented the default values for the `CELERYD_CONCURRENCY`
  and `CELERYD_PREFETCH_MULTIPLIER` settings.
- Tasks User Guide: Fixed typos in the subtask example
- celery.signals: Documented worker\_process\_init.
- Daemonization cookbook: Need to export DJANGO\_SETTINGS\_MODULE in
  /etc/default/celeryd.
- Added some more FAQs from stack overflow
- Daemonization cookbook: Fixed typo CELERYD\_LOGFILE/CELERYD\_PIDFILE

  > to CELERYD\_LOG\_FILE / CELERYD\_PID\_FILE
  >
  > Also added troubleshooting section for the init-scripts.

release-by:
:   Ask Solem

- Routes: When using the dict route syntax, the exchange for a task
  could disappear making the task unroutable.

  > See issue #158.
- Test suite now passing on Python 2.4
- No longer have to type PYTHONPATH=. to use `celeryconfig` in the current
  directory.

  > This is accomplished by the default loader ensuring that the current
  > directory is in sys.path when loading the config module.
  > sys.path is reset to its original state after loading.
  >
  > Adding the current working directory to sys.path without the user
  > knowing may be a security issue, as this means someone can drop a Python module in the users
  > directory that executes arbitrary commands. This was the original reason
  > not to do this, but if done *only when loading the config module*, this
  > means that the behavior will only apply to the modules imported in the
  > config module, which I think is a good compromise (certainly better than
  > just explicitly setting PYTHONPATH=. anyway)
- Experimental Cassandra backend added.
- Worker: SIGHUP handler accidentally propagated to worker pool processes.

  > In combination with [GitHub SHA@7a7c44e39344789f11b5346e9cc8340f5fe4846c](https://github.com/celery/celery/commit/7a7c44e39344789f11b5346e9cc8340f5fe4846c)
  > this would make each child process start a new worker instance when
  > the terminal window was closed :/
- Worker: Don’t install SIGHUP handler if running from a terminal.

  > This fixes the problem where the worker is launched in the background
  > when closing the terminal.
- Worker: Now joins threads at shutdown.

  > See issue #152.
- Test tear down: Don’t use atexit but nose’s teardown() functionality
  instead.

  > See issue #154.
- Debian worker init-script: Stop now works correctly.
- Task logger: warn method added (synonym for warning)
- Can now define a white list of errors to send error emails for.

  > Example:
  >
  > ```
  > CELERY_TASK_ERROR_WHITELIST = ('myapp.MalformedInputError',)
  > ```
  >
  > See issue #153.
- Worker: Now handles overflow exceptions in time.mktime while parsing
  the ETA field.
- LoggerWrapper: Try to detect loggers logging back to stderr/stdout making
  an infinite loop.
- Added `celery.task.control.inspect`: Inspects a running worker.

  > Examples:
  >
  > ```
  > # Inspect a single worker
  > >>> i = inspect('myworker.example.com')
  >
  > # Inspect several workers
  > >>> i = inspect(['myworker.example.com', 'myworker2.example.com'])
  >
  > # Inspect all workers consuming on this vhost.
  > >>> i = inspect()
  >
  > ### Methods
  >
  > # Get currently executing tasks
  > >>> i.active()
  >
  > # Get currently reserved tasks
  > >>> i.reserved()
  >
  > # Get the current ETA schedule
  > >>> i.scheduled()
  >
  > # Worker statistics and info
  > >>> i.stats()
  >
  > # List of currently revoked tasks
  > >>> i.revoked()
  >
  > # List of registered tasks
  > >>> i.registered_tasks()
  > ```
- Remote control commands dump\_active/dump\_reserved/dump\_schedule
  now replies with detailed task requests.

  > Containing the original arguments and fields of the task requested.
  >
  > In addition the remote control command set\_loglevel has been added,
  > this only changes the log level for the main process.
- Worker control command execution now catches errors and returns their
  string representation in the reply.
- Functional test suite added

  > `celery.tests.functional.case` contains utilities to start
  > and stop an embedded worker process, for use in functional testing.

- multiprocessing.pool: Now handles encoding errors, so that pickling errors
  doesn’t crash the worker processes.
- The remote control command replies wasn’t working with RabbitMQ 1.8.0’s
  stricter equivalence checks.

  > If you’ve already hit this problem you may have to delete the
  > declaration:
  >
  > ```
  > $ camqadm exchange.delete celerycrq
  > ```
  >
  > or:
  >
  > ```
  > $ python manage.py camqadm exchange.delete celerycrq
  > ```
- A bug sneaked in the ETA scheduler that made it only able to execute
  one task per second(!)

  > The scheduler sleeps between iterations so it doesn’t consume too much CPU.
  > It keeps a list of the scheduled items sorted by time, at each iteration
  > it sleeps for the remaining time of the item with the nearest deadline.
  > If there are no ETA tasks it will sleep for a minimum amount of time, one
  > second by default.
  >
  > A bug sneaked in here, making it sleep for one second for every task
  > that was scheduled. This has been fixed, so now it should move
  > tasks like hot knife through butter.
  >
  > In addition a new setting has been added to control the minimum sleep
  > interval; `CELERYD_ETA_SCHEDULER_PRECISION`. A good
  > value for this would be a float between 0 and 1, depending
  > on the needed precision. A value of 0.8 means that when the ETA of a task
  > is met, it will take at most 0.8 seconds for the task to be moved to the
  > ready queue.
- Pool: Supervisor didn’t release the semaphore.

  > This would lead to a deadlock if all workers terminated prematurely.
- Added Python version trove classifiers: 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7
- Tests now passing on Python 2.7.
- Task.\_\_reduce\_\_: Tasks created using the task decorator can now be pickled.
- `setup.py`: <https://pypi.org/project/nose/> added to tests\_require.
- Pickle should now work with SQLAlchemy 0.5.x
- New homepage design by Jan Henrik Helmers: <http://celeryproject.org>
- New Sphinx theme by Armin Ronacher: <https://docs.celeryq.dev/>
- Fixed “pending\_xref” errors shown in the HTML rendering of the
  documentation. Apparently this was caused by new changes in Sphinx 1.0b2.
- Router classes in `CELERY_ROUTES` are now imported lazily.

  > Importing a router class in a module that also loads the Celery
  > environment would cause a circular dependency. This is solved
  > by importing it when needed after the environment is set up.
- `CELERY_ROUTES` was broken if set to a single dict.

  > This example in the docs should now work again:
  >
  > ```
  > CELERY_ROUTES = {'feed.tasks.import_feed': 'feeds'}
  > ```
- CREATE\_MISSING\_QUEUES wasn’t honored by apply\_async.
- New remote control command: stats

  > Dumps information about the worker, like pool process ids, and
  > total number of tasks executed by type.
  >
  > Example reply:
  >
  > ```
  > [{'worker.local':
  >      'total': {'tasks.sleeptask': 6},
  >      'pool': {'timeouts': [None, None],
  >               'processes': [60376, 60377],
  >               'max-concurrency': 2,
  >               'max-tasks-per-child': None,
  >               'put-guarded-by-semaphore': True}}]
  > ```
- New remote control command: dump\_active

  > Gives a list of tasks currently being executed by the worker.
  > By default arguments are passed through repr in case there
  > are arguments that’s not JSON encodable. If you know
  > the arguments are JSON safe, you can pass the argument safe=True.
  >
  > Example reply:
  >
  > ```
  > >>> broadcast('dump_active', arguments={'safe': False}, reply=True)
  > [{'worker.local': [
  >     {'args': '(1,)',
  >      'time_start': 1278580542.6300001,
  >      'name': 'tasks.sleeptask',
  >      'delivery_info': {
  >          'consumer_tag': '30',
  >          'routing_key': 'celery',
  >          'exchange': 'celery'},
  >      'hostname': 'casper.local',
  >      'acknowledged': True,
  >      'kwargs': '{}',
  >      'id': '802e93e9-e470-47ed-b913-06de8510aca2',
  >     }
  > ]}]
  > ```
- Added experimental support for persistent revokes.

  > Use the -S|–statedb argument to the worker to enable it:
  >
  > ```
  > $ celeryd --statedb=/var/run/celeryd
  > ```
  >
  > This will use the file: /var/run/celeryd.db,
  > as the shelve module automatically adds the .db suffix.

### 

Celery 2.0 contains backward incompatible changes, the most important
being that the Django dependency has been removed so Celery no longer
supports Django out of the box, but instead as an add-on package
called <https://pypi.org/project/django-celery/>.

We’re very sorry for breaking backwards compatibility, but there’s
also many new and exciting features to make up for the time you lose
upgrading, so be sure to read the [News](#v200-news) section.

Quite a lot of potential users have been upset about the Django dependency,
so maybe this is a chance to get wider adoption by the Python community as
well.

Big thanks to all contributors, testers and users!

### 

Django integration has been moved to a separate package: <https://pypi.org/project/django-celery/>.

- To upgrade you need to install the <https://pypi.org/project/django-celery/> module and change:

  ```
  INSTALLED_APPS = 'celery'
  ```

  to:

  ```
  INSTALLED_APPS = 'djcelery'
  ```
- If you use mod\_wsgi you need to add the following line to your .wsgi
  file:

  > ```
  > import os
  > os.environ['CELERY_LOADER'] = 'django'
  > ```
- The following modules has been moved to <https://pypi.org/project/django-celery/>:

  > | **Module name** | **Replace with** |
  > | --- | --- |
  > | celery.models | djcelery.models |
  > | celery.managers | djcelery.managers |
  > | celery.views | djcelery.views |
  > | celery.urls | djcelery.urls |
  > | celery.management | djcelery.management |
  > | celery.loaders.djangoapp | djcelery.loaders |
  > | celery.backends.database | djcelery.backends.database |
  > | celery.backends.cache | djcelery.backends.cache |

Importing `djcelery` will automatically setup Celery to use Django loader.
loader. It does this by setting the `CELERY_LOADER` environment variable to
“django” (it won’t change it if a loader is already set).

When the Django loader is used, the “database” and “cache” result backend
aliases will point to the `djcelery` backends instead of the built-in backends,
and configuration will be read from the Django settings.

### 

#### 

The database result backend is now using [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org) instead of the
Django ORM, see [Supported Databases](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/core/engines.html#supported-databases) for a table of supported databases.

The DATABASE\_\* settings has been replaced by a single setting:
`CELERY_RESULT_DBURI`. The value here should be an
[SQLAlchemy Connection String](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/core/engines.html#database-urls), some examples include:

```
# sqlite (filename)
CELERY_RESULT_DBURI = 'sqlite:///celerydb.sqlite'

# mysql
CELERY_RESULT_DBURI = 'mysql://scott:tiger@localhost/foo'

# postgresql
CELERY_RESULT_DBURI = 'postgresql://scott:tiger@localhost/mydatabase'

# oracle
CELERY_RESULT_DBURI = 'oracle://scott:tiger@127.0.0.1:1521/sidname'
```

See [SQLAlchemy Connection Strings](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/core/engines.html#database-urls) for more information about connection
strings.

To specify additional SQLAlchemy database engine options you can use
the `CELERY_RESULT_ENGINE_OPTIONS` setting:

> ```
> # echo enables verbose logging from SQLAlchemy.
> CELERY_RESULT_ENGINE_OPTIONS = {'echo': True}
> ```

#### 

The cache result backend is no longer using the Django cache framework,
but it supports mostly the same configuration syntax:

> ```
> CELERY_CACHE_BACKEND = 'memcached://A.example.com:11211;B.example.com'
> ```

To use the cache backend you must either have the <https://pypi.org/project/pylibmc/> or
<https://pypi.org/project/python-memcached/> library installed, of which the former is regarded
as the best choice.

The support backend types are memcached:// and memory://,
we haven’t felt the need to support any of the other backends
provided by Django.

### 

- Default (python) loader now prints warning on missing celeryconfig.py
  instead of raising [`ImportError`](https://docs.python.org/dev/library/exceptions.html#ImportError "(in Python v3.15)").

  > The worker raises [`ImproperlyConfigured`](../reference/celery.exceptions.html#celery.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured "celery.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured") if the configuration
  > isn’t set up. This makes it possible to use –help etc., without having a
  > working configuration.
  >
  > Also this makes it possible to use the client side of Celery without being
  > configured:
  >
  > ```
  > >>> from carrot.connection import BrokerConnection
  > >>> conn = BrokerConnection('localhost', 'guest', 'guest', '/')
  > >>> from celery.execute import send_task
  > >>> r = send_task('celery.ping', args=(), kwargs={}, connection=conn)
  > >>> from celery.backends.amqp import AMQPBackend
  > >>> r.backend = AMQPBackend(connection=conn)
  > >>> r.get()
  > 'pong'
  > ```
- The following deprecated settings has been removed (as scheduled by
  the [Celery Deprecation Time-line](../internals/deprecation.html#deprecation-timeline)):

  > | **Setting name** | **Replace with** |
  > | --- | --- |
  > | CELERY\_AMQP\_CONSUMER\_QUEUES | CELERY\_QUEUES |
  > | CELERY\_AMQP\_EXCHANGE | CELERY\_DEFAULT\_EXCHANGE |
  > | CELERY\_AMQP\_EXCHANGE\_TYPE | CELERY\_DEFAULT\_EXCHANGE\_TYPE |
  > | CELERY\_AMQP\_CONSUMER\_ROUTING\_KEY | CELERY\_QUEUES |
  > | CELERY\_AMQP\_PUBLISHER\_ROUTING\_KEY | CELERY\_DEFAULT\_ROUTING\_KEY |
- The celery.task.rest module has been removed, use celery.task.http
  instead (as scheduled by the [Celery Deprecation Time-line](../internals/deprecation.html#deprecation-timeline)).
- It’s no longer allowed to skip the class name in loader names.
  (as scheduled by the [Celery Deprecation Time-line](../internals/deprecation.html#deprecation-timeline)):

  > Assuming the implicit Loader class name is no longer supported,
  > for example, if you use:
  >
  > ```
  > CELERY_LOADER = 'myapp.loaders'
  > ```
  >
  > You need to include the loader class name, like this:
  >
  > ```
  > CELERY_LOADER = 'myapp.loaders.Loader'
  > ```
- `CELERY_TASK_RESULT_EXPIRES` now defaults to 1 day.

  > Previous default setting was to expire in 5 days.
- AMQP backend: Don’t use different values for auto\_delete.

  > This bug became visible with RabbitMQ 1.8.0, which no longer
  > allows conflicting declarations for the auto\_delete and durable settings.
  >
  > If you’ve already used Celery with this backend chances are you
  > have to delete the previous declaration:
  >
  > ```
  > $ camqadm exchange.delete celeryresults
  > ```
- Now uses pickle instead of cPickle on Python versions <= 2.5

  > cPickle is broken in Python <= 2.5.
  >
  > It unsafely and incorrectly uses relative instead of absolute imports,
  > so for example:
  >
  > ```
  > exceptions.KeyError
  > ```
  >
  > becomes:
  >
  > ```
  > celery.exceptions.KeyError
  > ```
  >
  > Your best choice is to upgrade to Python 2.6,
  > as while the pure pickle version has worse performance,
  > it is the only safe option for older Python versions.

### 

- **celeryev**: Curses Celery Monitor and Event Viewer.

- AMQP result backend: Now supports .ready(), .successful(),
  .result, .status, and even responds to changes in task state
- New user guides:

  > - [Workers Guide](../userguide/workers.html#guide-workers)
  > - [Canvas: Designing Work-flows](../userguide/canvas.html#guide-canvas)
  > - [Routing Tasks](../userguide/routing.html#guide-routing)
- Worker: Standard out/error is now being redirected to the log file.
- <https://pypi.org/project/billiard/> has been moved back to the Celery repository.

  > | **Module name** | **celery equivalent** |
  > | --- | --- |
  > | billiard.pool | celery.concurrency.processes.pool |
  > | billiard.serialization | celery.serialization |
  > | billiard.utils.functional | celery.utils.functional |
  >
  > The <https://pypi.org/project/billiard/> distribution may be maintained, depending on interest.
- now depends on <https://pypi.org/project/carrot/> >= 0.10.5
- now depends on <https://pypi.org/project/pyparsing/>
- Worker: Added –purge as an alias to –discard.
- Worker: `Control`-`c` (SIGINT) once does warm shutdown,
  hitting `Control`-`c` twice forces termination.
- Added support for using complex Crontab-expressions in periodic tasks. For
  example, you can now use:

  > ```
  > >>> crontab(minute='*/15')
  > ```
  >
  > or even:
  >
  > ```
  > >>> crontab(minute='*/30', hour='8-17,1-2', day_of_week='thu-fri')
  > ```

  See [Periodic Tasks](../userguide/periodic-tasks.html#guide-beat).
- Worker: Now waits for available pool processes before applying new
  tasks to the pool.

  > This means it doesn’t have to wait for dozens of tasks to finish at shutdown
  > because it has applied prefetched tasks without having any pool
  > processes available to immediately accept them.
  >
  > See issue #122.
- New built-in way to do task callbacks using
  `subtask`.

  See [Canvas: Designing Work-flows](../userguide/canvas.html#guide-canvas) for more information.
- TaskSets can now contain several types of tasks.

  `TaskSet` has been refactored to use
  a new syntax, please see [Canvas: Designing Work-flows](../userguide/canvas.html#guide-canvas) for more information.

  The previous syntax is still supported, but will be deprecated in
  version 1.4.
- TaskSet failed() result was incorrect.

  > See issue #132.
- Now creates different loggers per task class.

  > See issue #129.
- Missing queue definitions are now created automatically.

  > > You can disable this using the `CELERY_CREATE_MISSING_QUEUES`
  > > setting.
  > >
  > > The missing queues are created with the following options:
  > >
  > > ```
  > > CELERY_QUEUES[name] = {'exchange': name,

  > >                        'routing_key': 'name}
  > > ```
  >
  > This feature is added for easily setting up routing using the -Q
  > option to the worker:

  > ```
  > $ celeryd -Q video, image
  > ```
  >
  > See the new routing section of the User Guide for more information:
  > [Routing Tasks](../userguide/routing.html#guide-routing).
- New Task option: Task.queue

  > If set, message options will be taken from the corresponding entry
  > in `CELERY_QUEUES`. exchange, exchange\_type and routing\_key
  > will be ignored
- Added support for task soft and hard time limits.

  > New settings added:
  >
  > - `CELERYD_TASK_TIME_LIMIT`
  >
  >   > Hard time limit. The worker processing the task will be killed and
  >   > replaced with a new one when this is exceeded.
  > - `CELERYD_TASK_SOFT_TIME_LIMIT`
  >
  >   > Soft time limit. The [`SoftTimeLimitExceeded`](../reference/celery.exceptions.html#celery.exceptions.SoftTimeLimitExceeded "celery.exceptions.SoftTimeLimitExceeded")

- Test suite is now passing without a running broker, using the carrot
  in-memory backend.
- Log output is now available in colors.

  > | **Log level** | **Color** |
  > | --- | --- |
  > | DEBUG | Blue |
  > | WARNING | Yellow |
  > | CRITICAL | Magenta |
  > | ERROR | Red |
  >
  > This is only enabled when the log output is a tty.
  > You can explicitly enable/disable this feature using the
  > `CELERYD_LOG_COLOR` setting.
- Added support for task router classes (like the django multi-db routers)

  > - New setting: `CELERY_ROUTES`
  >
  > This is a single, or a list of routers to traverse when
  > sending tasks. Dictionaries in this list converts to a
  > `celery.routes.MapRoute` instance.
  >
  > Examples:
  >
  > ```
  > >>> CELERY_ROUTES = {'celery.ping': 'default',
  >                      'mytasks.add': 'cpu-bound',
  >                      'video.encode': {
  >                          'queue': 'video',
  >                          'exchange': 'media'
  >                          'routing_key': 'media.video.encode'}}
  > ```
  >
  > ```
  > >>> CELERY_ROUTES = ('myapp.tasks.Router',
  >                      {'celery.ping': 'default'})
  > ```
  >
  > Where myapp.tasks.Router could be:
  >
  > ```
  > class Router(object):
  >
  >     def route_for_task(self, task, args=None, kwargs=None):
  >         if task == 'celery.ping':
  >             return 'default'
  > ```
  >
  > route\_for\_task may return a string or a dict. A string then means
  > it’s a queue name in `CELERY_QUEUES`, a dict means it’s a custom route.
  >
  > When sending tasks, the routers are consulted in order. The first
  > router that doesn’t return None is the route to use. The message options
  > is then merged with the found route settings, where the routers settings
  > have priority.
  >
  > Example if `apply_async()` has these arguments:
  >
  > ```
  > >>> Task.apply_async(immediate=False, exchange='video',
  > ...                  routing_key='video.compress')
  > ```
  >
  > and a router returns:
  >
  > ```
  > {'immediate': True,
  >  'exchange': 'urgent'}
  > ```
  >
  > the final message options will be:
  >
  > ```
  > >>> task.apply_async(
  > ...    immediate=True,
  > ...    exchange='urgent',
  > ...    routing_key='video.compress',
  > ... )
  > ```
  >
  > (and any default message options defined in the
  > `Task` class)
- New Task handler called after the task returns:
  `after_return()`.
- `ExceptionInfo` now passed to
  :   `on_retry()`/
      `on_failure()` as `einfo` keyword argument.
- Worker: Added `CELERYD_MAX_TASKS_PER_CHILD` /
  `celery worker --maxtasksperchild`.

  > Defines the maximum number of tasks a pool worker can process before
  > the process is terminated and replaced by a new one.
- Revoked tasks now marked with state [`REVOKED`](../userguide/tasks.html#std-state-REVOKED), and result.get()
  will now raise [`TaskRevokedError`](../reference/celery.exceptions.html#celery.exceptions.TaskRevokedError "celery.exceptions.TaskRevokedError").
- `celery.task.control.ping()` now works as expected.
- apply(throw=True) / `CELERY_EAGER_PROPAGATES_EXCEPTIONS`:
  Makes eager execution re-raise task errors.
- New signal: `~celery.signals.worker_process_init`: Sent inside the
  pool worker process at init.
- Worker: [`celery worker -Q`](../reference/cli.html#cmdoption-celery-worker-Q) option: Ability to specify list of queues
  to use, disabling other configured queues.

  > For example, if `CELERY_QUEUES` defines four
  > queues: image, video, data and default, the following
  > command would make the worker only consume from the image and video
  > queues:
  >
  > ```
  > $ celeryd -Q image,video
  > ```
- Worker: New return value for the revoke control command:

  > Now returns:
  >
  > ```
  > {'ok': 'task $id revoked'}
  > ```
  >
  > instead of `True`.
- Worker: Can now enable/disable events using remote control

  > Example usage:
  >
  > ```
  > >>> from celery.task.control import broadcast
  > >>> broadcast('enable_events')
  > >>> broadcast('disable_events')
  > ```
- Removed top-level tests directory. Test config now in celery.tests.config

  > This means running the unit tests doesn’t require any special setup.
  > celery/tests/\_\_init\_\_ now configures the `CELERY_CONFIG_MODULE`
  > and `CELERY_LOADER` environment variables, so when nosetests
  > imports that, the unit test environment is all set up.
  >
  > Before you run the tests you need to install the test requirements:
  >
  > ```
  > $ pip install -r requirements/test.txt
  > ```
  >
  > Running all tests:
  >
  > ```
  > $ nosetests
  > ```
  >
  > Specifying the tests to run:
  >
  > ```
  > $ nosetests celery.tests.test_task
  > ```
  >
  > Producing HTML coverage:
  >
  > ```
  > $ nosetests --with-coverage3
  > ```
  >
  > The coverage output is then located in celery/tests/cover/index.html.
- Worker: New option –version: Dump version info and exit.
- `celeryd-multi`: Tool for shell scripts
  to start multiple workers.

  > Some examples:
  >
  > - Advanced example with 10 workers:
  >
  >   > - Three of the workers processes the images and video queue
  >   > - Two of the workers processes the data queue with loglevel DEBUG
  >   > - the rest processes the default’ queue.
  >   >
  >   > ```
  >   > $ celeryd-multi start 10 -l INFO -Q:1-3 images,video -Q:4,5:data -Q default -L:4,5 DEBUG
  >   > ```
  > - Get commands to start 10 workers, with 3 processes each
  >
  >   > ```
  >   > $ celeryd-multi start 3 -c 3
  >   > celeryd -n celeryd1.myhost -c 3
  >   > celeryd -n celeryd2.myhost -c 3
  >   > celeryd -n celeryd3.myhost -c 3
  >   > ```
  > - Start 3 named workers
  >
  >   > ```
  >   > $ celeryd-multi start image video data -c 3
  >   > celeryd -n image.myhost -c 3
  >   > celeryd -n video.myhost -c 3
  >   > celeryd -n data.myhost -c 3
  >   > ```
  > - Specify custom hostname
  >
  >   > ```

  >   > celeryd -n celeryd1.worker.example.com -c 3
  >   > celeryd -n celeryd2.worker.example.com -c 3
  >   > ```
  >   >
  >   > Additional options are added to each `celeryd`,
  >   > but you can also modify the options for ranges of or single workers
  > - 3 workers: Two with 3 processes, and one with 10 processes.
  >
  >   > ```
  >   > $ celeryd-multi start 3 -c 3 -c:1 10
  >   > celeryd -n celeryd1.myhost -c 10
  >   > celeryd -n celeryd2.myhost -c 3
  >   > celeryd -n celeryd3.myhost -c 3
  >   > ```
  > - Can also specify options for named workers
  >
  >   > ```
  >   > $ celeryd-multi start image video data -c 3 -c:image 10
  >   > celeryd -n image.myhost -c 10
  >   > celeryd -n video.myhost -c 3
  >   > celeryd -n data.myhost -c 3
  >   > ```
  > - Ranges and lists of workers in options is also allowed:
  >   (`-c:1-3` can also be written as `-c:1,2,3`)
  >
  >   > ```
  >   > $ celeryd-multi start 5 -c 3  -c:1-3 10
  >   > celeryd-multi -n celeryd1.myhost -c 10
  >   > celeryd-multi -n celeryd2.myhost -c 10
  >   > celeryd-multi -n celeryd3.myhost -c 10
  >   > celeryd-multi -n celeryd4.myhost -c 3
  >   > celeryd-multi -n celeryd5.myhost -c 3
  >   > ```
  > - Lists also work with named workers:
  >
  >   > ```
  >   > $ celeryd-multi start foo bar baz xuzzy -c 3 -c:foo,bar,baz 10
  >   > celeryd-multi -n foo.myhost -c 10
  >   > celeryd-multi -n bar.myhost -c 10
  >   > celeryd-multi -n baz.myhost -c 10
  >   > celeryd-multi -n xuzzy.myhost -c 3
  >   > ```
- The worker now calls the result backends process\_cleanup method
  *after* task execution instead of before.
- AMQP result backend now supports Pika.
