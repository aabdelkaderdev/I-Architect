# What’s new in Celery 3.1 (Cipater)

Author:
:   Ask Solem (`ask at celeryproject.org`)

Celery is a simple, flexible, and reliable distributed system to
process vast amounts of messages, while providing operations with
the tools required to maintain such a system.

It’s a task queue with focus on real-time processing, while also
supporting task scheduling.

Celery has a large and diverse community of users and contributors,
you should come join us on IRC
or our mailing-list.

To read more about Celery you should go read the [introduction](../getting-started/introduction.html#intro).

While this version is backward compatible with previous versions
it’s important that you read the following section.

This version is officially supported on CPython 2.6, 2.7, and 3.3,
and also supported on PyPy.

## 

Deadlocks have long plagued our workers, and while uncommon they’re
not acceptable. They’re also infamous for being extremely hard to diagnose
and reproduce, so to make this job easier I wrote a stress test suite that
bombards the worker with different tasks in an attempt to break it.

What happens if thousands of worker child processes are killed every
second? what if we also kill the broker connection every 10
seconds? These are examples of what the stress test suite will do to the
worker, and it reruns these tests using different configuration combinations
to find edge case bugs.

The end result was that I had to rewrite the prefork pool to avoid the use
of the POSIX semaphore. This was extremely challenging, but after
months of hard work the worker now finally passes the stress test suite.

There’s probably more bugs to find, but the good news is
that we now have a tool to reproduce them, so should you be so unlucky to
experience a bug then we’ll write a test for it and squash it!

Note that I’ve also moved many broker transports into experimental status:
the only transports recommended for production use today is RabbitMQ and
Redis.

I don’t have the resources to maintain all of them, so bugs are left
unresolved. I wish that someone will step up and take responsibility for
these transports or donate resources to improve them, but as the situation
is now I don’t think the quality is up to date with the rest of the code-base
so I cannot recommend them for production use.

The next version of Celery 4.0 will focus on performance and removing
rarely used parts of the library. Work has also started on a new message
protocol, supporting multiple languages and more. The initial draft can
be found [here](../internals/protocol.html#message-protocol-task-v2).

This has probably been the hardest release I’ve worked on, so no
introduction to this changelog would be complete without a massive
thank you to everyone who contributed and helped me test it!

Thank you for your support!

## 

### 

Celery now requires Python 2.6 or later.

The new dual code base runs on both Python 2 and 3, without
requiring the `2to3` porting tool.

Note

This is also the last version to support Python 2.6! From Celery 4.0 and
on-wards Python 2.7 or later will be required.

### 

Starting from Celery 4.0 the default serializer will be json.

If you depend on pickle being accepted you should be prepared
for this change by explicitly allowing your worker
to consume pickled messages using the `CELERY_ACCEPT_CONTENT`
setting:

```
CELERY_ACCEPT_CONTENT = ['pickle', 'json', 'msgpack', 'yaml']
```

Make sure you only select the serialization formats you’ll actually be using,
and make sure you’ve properly secured your broker from unwanted access
(see the [Security Guide](../userguide/security.html#guide-security)).

The worker will emit a deprecation warning if you don’t define this setting.

### 

Everyone should move to the new **celery** umbrella
command, so we’re incrementally deprecating the old command names.

In this version we’ve removed all commands that aren’t used
in init-scripts. The rest will be removed in 4.0.

| Program | New Status | Replacement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `celeryd` | *DEPRECATED* | **celery worker** |
| `celerybeat` | *DEPRECATED* | **celery beat** |
| `celeryd-multi` | *DEPRECATED* | **celery multi** |
| `celeryctl` | **REMOVED** | **celery inspect|control** |
| `celeryev` | **REMOVED** | **celery events** |
| `camqadm` | **REMOVED** | **celery amqp** |

If this isn’t a new installation then you may want to remove the old
commands:

```
$ pip uninstall celery
$ # repeat until it fails
# ...
$ pip uninstall celery
$ pip install celery
```

Please run **celery --help** for help using the umbrella command.

## 

### 

These improvements are only active if you use an async capable
transport. This means only RabbitMQ (AMQP) and Redis are supported
at this point and other transports will still use the thread-based fallback
implementation.

- Pool is now using one IPC queue per child process.

  > Previously the pool shared one queue between all child processes,
  > using a POSIX semaphore as a mutex to achieve exclusive read and write
  > access.
  >
  > The POSIX semaphore has now been removed and each child process
  > gets a dedicated queue. This means that the worker will require more
  > file descriptors (two descriptors per process), but it also means
  > that performance is improved and we can send work to individual child
  > processes.
  >
  > POSIX semaphores aren’t released when a process is killed, so killing
  > processes could lead to a deadlock if it happened while the semaphore was
  > acquired. There’s no good solution to fix this, so the best option
  > was to remove the semaphore.
- Asynchronous write operations

  > The pool now uses async I/O to send work to the child processes.
- Lost process detection is now immediate.

  > If a child process is killed or exits mysteriously the pool previously
  > had to wait for 30 seconds before marking the task with a
  > [`WorkerLostError`](../reference/celery.exceptions.html#celery.exceptions.WorkerLostError "celery.exceptions.WorkerLostError"). It had to do this because
  > the out-queue was shared between all processes, and the pool couldn’t
  > be certain whether the process completed the task or not. So an arbitrary
  > timeout of 30 seconds was chosen, as it was believed that the out-queue
  > would’ve been drained by this point.
  >
  > This timeout is no longer necessary, and so the task can be marked as
  > failed as soon as the pool gets the notification that the process exited.
- Rare race conditions fixed

  > Most of these bugs were never reported to us, but were discovered while
  > running the new stress test suite.

#### Caveats

### 

Celery 3.0 introduced a shiny new API, but unfortunately didn’t
have a solution for Django users.

The situation changes with this version as Django is now supported
in core and new Django users coming to Celery are now expected
to use the new API directly.

The Django community has a convention where there’s a separate
`django-x` package for every library, acting like a bridge between
Django and the library.

Having a separate project for Django users has been a pain for Celery,
with multiple issue trackers and multiple documentation
sources, and then lastly since 3.0 we even had different APIs.

With this version we challenge that convention and Django users will
use the same library, the same API and the same documentation as
everyone else.

There’s no rush to port your existing code to use the new API,
but if you’d like to experiment with it you should know that:

- You need to use a Celery application instance.

  > The new Celery API introduced in 3.0 requires users to instantiate the
  > library by creating an application:
  >
  > ```
  > from celery import Celery
  >
  > app = Celery()
  > ```
- You need to explicitly integrate Celery with Django

  > Celery won’t automatically use the Django settings, so you can
  > either configure Celery separately or you can tell it to use the Django
  > settings with:
  >
  > ```
  > app.config_from_object('django.conf:settings')
  > ```
  >
  > Neither will it automatically traverse your installed apps to find task
  > modules. If you want this behavior, you must explicitly pass a list of
  > Django instances to the Celery app:
  >
  > ```
  > from django.conf import settings
  > app.autodiscover_tasks(lambda: settings.INSTALLED_APPS)
  > ```
- You no longer use `manage.py`

  > Instead you use the **celery** command directly:
  >
  > ```
  > $ celery -A proj worker -l info
  > ```
  >
  > For this to work your app module must store the [`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`](http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/settings/#envvar-DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE "(in Django v6.1)")
  > environment variable, see the example in the [Django
  > guide](../django/first-steps-with-django.html#django-first-steps).

To get started with the new API you should first read the [First Steps with Celery](../getting-started/first-steps-with-celery.html#first-steps)
tutorial, and then you should read the Django-specific instructions in
[First steps with Django](../django/first-steps-with-django.html#django-first-steps).

The fixes and improvements applied by the <https://pypi.org/project/django-celery/> library
are now automatically applied by core Celery when it detects that
the [`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`](http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/settings/#envvar-DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE "(in Django v6.1)") environment variable is set.

The distribution ships with a new example project using Django
in `examples/django`:

<https://github.com/celery/celery/tree/3.1/examples/django>

Some features still require the <https://pypi.org/project/django-celery/> library:

> - Celery doesn’t implement the Django database or cache result backends.
> - Celery doesn’t ship with the database-based periodic task
>   :   scheduler.

Note

If you’re still using the old API when you upgrade to Celery 3.1
then you must make sure that your settings module contains
the `djcelery.setup_loader()` line, since this will
no longer happen as a side-effect of importing the <https://pypi.org/project/django-celery/>
module.

New users (or if you’ve ported to the new API) don’t need the `setup_loader`
line anymore, and must make sure to remove it.

### 

Keeping physical clocks in perfect sync is impossible, so using
time-stamps to order events in a distributed system isn’t reliable.

Celery event messages have included a logical clock value for some time,
but starting with this version that field is also used to order them.

Also, events now record timezone information
by including a new `utcoffset` field in the event message.
This is a signed integer telling the difference from UTC time in hours,
so for example, an event sent from the Europe/London timezone in daylight savings
time will have an offset of 1.

`app.events.Receiver` will automatically convert the time-stamps
to the local timezone.

Note

The logical clock is synchronized with other nodes
in the same cluster (neighbors), so this means that the logical
epoch will start at the point when the first worker in the cluster
starts.

If all of the workers are shutdown the clock value will be lost
and reset to 0. To protect against this, you should specify the
[`celery worker --statedb`](../reference/cli.html#cmdoption-celery-worker-S) option such that the worker can
persist the clock value at shutdown.

You may notice that the logical clock is an integer value and
increases very rapidly. Don’t worry about the value overflowing
though, as even in the most busy clusters it may take several
millennium before the clock exceeds a 64 bits value.

### 

Node names are now constructed by two elements: name and host-name
separated by ‘@’.

This change was made to more easily identify multiple instances running
on the same machine.

If a custom name isn’t specified then the
worker will use the name ‘celery’ by default, resulting in a
fully qualified node name of [‘celery@hostname](mailto:'celery%40hostname)’:

```
$ celery worker -n example.com
celery@example.com
```

To also set the name you must include the @:

```
$ celery worker -n worker1@example.com
worker1@example.com
```

The worker will identify itself using the fully qualified
node name in events and broadcast messages, so where before
a worker would identify itself as ‘worker1.example.com’, it’ll now
use [‘celery@worker1.example.com](mailto:'celery%40worker1.example.com)’.

Remember that the [`-n`](../reference/cli.html#cmdoption-celery-worker-n) argument also supports
simple variable substitutions, so if the current host-name
is *george.example.com* then the `%h` macro will expand into that:

```
$ celery worker -n worker1@%h
worker1@george.example.com
```

The available substitutions are as follows:

| Variable | Substitution |
| --- | --- |
| `%h` | Full host-name (including domain name) |
| `%d` | Domain name only |
| `%n` | Host-name only (without domain name) |
| `%%` | The character `%` |

### 

The task decorator can now create “bound tasks”, which means that the
task will receive the `self` argument.

```
@app.task(bind=True)
def send_twitter_status(self, oauth, tweet):
    try:
        twitter = Twitter(oauth)
        twitter.update_status(tweet)
    except (Twitter.FailWhaleError, Twitter.LoginError) as exc:
        raise self.retry(exc=exc)
```

Using *bound tasks* is now the recommended approach whenever
you need access to the task instance or request context.
Previously one would’ve to refer to the name of the task
instead (`send_twitter_status.retry`), but this could lead to problems
in some configurations.

### 

The worker will now attempt to synchronize with other workers in
the same cluster.

Synchronized data currently includes revoked tasks and logical clock.

This only happens at start-up and causes a one second start-up delay
to collect broadcast responses from other workers.

You can disable this bootstep using the
[`celery worker --without-mingle`](../reference/cli.html#cmdoption-celery-worker-without-mingle) option.

### 

Workers are now passively subscribing to worker related events like
heartbeats.

This means that a worker knows what other workers are doing and
can detect if they go offline. Currently this is only used for clock
synchronization, but there are many possibilities for future additions
and you can write extensions that take advantage of this already.

Some ideas include consensus protocols, reroute task to best worker (based on
resource usage or data locality) or restarting workers when they crash.

We believe that although this is a small addition, it opens
amazing possibilities.

You can disable this bootstep using the
[`celery worker --without-gossip`](../reference/cli.html#cmdoption-celery-worker-without-gossip) option.

### 

By writing bootsteps you can now easily extend the consumer part
of the worker to add additional features, like custom message consumers.

The worker has been using bootsteps for some time, but these were never
documented. In this version the consumer part of the worker
has also been rewritten to use bootsteps and the new [Extensions and Bootsteps](../userguide/extending.html#guide-extending)
guide documents examples extending the worker, including adding
custom message consumers.

See the [Extensions and Bootsteps](../userguide/extending.html#guide-extending) guide for more information.

Note

Bootsteps written for older versions won’t be compatible
with this version, as the API has changed significantly.

The old API was experimental and internal but should you be so unlucky
to use it then please contact the mailing-list and we’ll help you port
the bootstep to the new API.

### 

This new experimental version of the `amqp` result backend is a good
alternative to use in classical RPC scenarios, where the process that initiates
the task is always the process to retrieve the result.

It uses Kombu to send and retrieve results, and each client
uses a unique queue for replies to be sent to. This avoids
the significant overhead of the original amqp result backend which creates
one queue per task.

By default results sent using this backend won’t persist, so they won’t
survive a broker restart. You can enable
the `CELERY_RESULT_PERSISTENT` setting to change that.

```
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = 'rpc'
CELERY_RESULT_PERSISTENT = True
```

Note that chords are currently not supported by the RPC backend.

### 

Two new options have been added to the Calling API: `time_limit` and
`soft_time_limit`:

```
>>> res = add.apply_async((2, 2), time_limit=10, soft_time_limit=8)

>>> res = add.subtask((2, 2), time_limit=10, soft_time_limit=8).delay()

>>> res = add.s(2, 2).set(time_limit=10, soft_time_limit=8).delay()
```

Contributed by Mher Movsisyan.

### 

Broadcast messages are currently seen by all virtual hosts when
using the Redis transport. You can now fix this by enabling a prefix to all channels
so that the messages are separated:

```
BROKER_TRANSPORT_OPTIONS = {'fanout_prefix': True}
```

Note that you’ll not be able to communicate with workers running older
versions or workers that doesn’t have this setting enabled.

This setting will be the default in a future version.

Related to Issue #1490.

### <https://pypi.org/project/pytz/> replaces <https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/> dependency

Celery no longer depends on the <https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/> library,
but instead a new dependency on the <https://pypi.org/project/pytz/> library was added.

The <https://pypi.org/project/pytz/> library was already recommended for accurate timezone support.

This also means that dependencies are the same for both Python 2 and
Python 3, and that the `requirements/default-py3k.txt` file has
been removed.

### Support for <https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/> extra requirements

Pip now supports the <https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/> extra requirements format,
so we’ve removed the old bundles concept, and instead specify
setuptools extras.

You install extras by specifying them inside brackets:

```
$ pip install celery[redis,mongodb]
```

The above will install the dependencies for Redis and MongoDB. You can list
as many extras as you want.

Warning

You can’t use the `celery-with-*` packages anymore, as these won’t be
updated to use Celery 3.1.

| Extension | Requirement entry | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Redis | `celery[redis]` | transport, result backend |
| MongoDB | `celery[mongodb]` | transport, result backend |
| CouchDB | `celery[couchdb]` | transport |
| Beanstalk | `celery[beanstalk]` | transport |
| ZeroMQ | `celery[zeromq]` | transport |
| Zookeeper | `celery[zookeeper]` | transport |
| SQLAlchemy | `celery[sqlalchemy]` | transport, result backend |
| librabbitmq | `celery[librabbitmq]` | transport (C amqp client) |

The complete list with examples is found in the [Bundles](../getting-started/introduction.html#bundles) section.

### 

A misunderstanding led to `Signature.__call__` being an alias of
`.delay` but this doesn’t conform to the calling API of `Task` which
calls the underlying task method.

This means that:

```
@app.task
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

add.s(2, 2)()
```

now does the same as calling the task directly:

```
>>> add(2, 2)
```

### 

- Now depends on [Kombu 3.0](https://docs.celeryq.dev/projects/kombu/en/main/changelog.html#version-3-0-0 "(in Kombu v5.6)").
- Now depends on <https://pypi.org/project/billiard/> version 3.3.
- Worker will now crash if running as the root user with pickle enabled.
- Canvas: `group.apply_async` and `chain.apply_async` no longer starts
  separate task.

  > That the group and chord primitives supported the “calling API” like other
  > subtasks was a nice idea, but it was useless in practice and often
  > confused users. If you still want this behavior you can define a
  > task to do it for you.
- New method `Signature.freeze()` can be used to “finalize”
  signatures/subtask.

- All events now include a `pid` field, which is the process id of the
  process that sent the event.
- Event heartbeats are now calculated based on the time when the event
  was received by the monitor, and not the time reported by the worker.

- `app.events.Receiver` now sets a `local_received` field for incoming
  events, which is set to the time of when the event was received.
- `app.events.Dispatcher` now accepts a `groups` argument
  which decides a white-list of event groups that’ll be sent.

- The `dump_conf` remote control command will now give the string
  representation for types that aren’t JSON compatible.
- Function celery.security.setup\_security is now [`app.setup_security()`](../reference/celery.html#celery.Celery.setup_security "celery.Celery.setup_security").
- Task retry now propagates the message expiry value (Issue #980).

  > The value is forwarded at is, so the expiry time won’t change.

  > This utility creates graphs in GraphViz dot format.
  >
  > You can create graphs from the currently installed bootsteps:
  >
  > ```
  > # Create graph of currently installed bootsteps in both the worker
  > # and consumer name-spaces.
  > $ celery graph bootsteps | dot -T png -o steps.png
  >
  > # Graph of the consumer name-space only.
  > $ celery graph bootsteps consumer | dot -T png -o consumer_only.png
  >
  > # Graph of the worker name-space only.
  > $ celery graph bootsteps worker | dot -T png -o worker_only.png
  > ```
  >
  > Or graphs of workers in a cluster:
  >
  > ```
  > # Create graph from the current cluster
  > $ celery graph workers | dot -T png -o workers.png
  >
  > # Create graph from a specified list of workers
  > $ celery graph workers nodes:w1,w2,w3 | dot -T png workers.png
  >
  > # also specify the number of threads in each worker
  > $ celery graph workers nodes:w1,w2,w3 threads:2,4,6
  >
  > # …also specify the broker and backend URLs shown in the graph
  > $ celery graph workers broker:amqp:// backend:redis://
  >
  > # …also specify the max number of workers/threads shown (wmax/tmax),
  > # enumerating anything that exceeds that number.
  > $ celery graph workers wmax:10 tmax:3
  > ```
- Changed the way that app instances are pickled.

  > Apps can now define a `__reduce_keys__` method that’s used instead
  > of the old `AppPickler` attribute. For example, if your app defines a custom
  > ‘foo’ attribute that needs to be preserved when pickling you can define
  > a `__reduce_keys__` as such:
  >
  > ```
  > import celery
  >
  > class Celery(celery.Celery):
  >
  >     def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
  >         super(Celery, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
  >         self.foo = kwargs.get('foo')
  >
  >     def __reduce_keys__(self):
  >         return super(Celery, self).__reduce_keys__().update(
  >             foo=self.foo,
  >         )
  > ```
  >
  > This is a much more convenient way to add support for pickling custom
  > attributes. The old `AppPickler` is still supported but its use is
  > discouraged and we would like to remove it in a future version.
- Ability to trace imports for debugging purposes.

  > The `C_IMPDEBUG` can be set to trace imports as they
  > occur:
  >
  > ```
  > $ C_IMDEBUG=1 celery worker -l info
  > ```
  >
  > ```
  > $ C_IMPDEBUG=1 celery shell
  > ```
- Message headers now available as part of the task request.

  > Example adding and retrieving a header value:
  >
  > ```
  > @app.task(bind=True)
  > def t(self):
  >     return self.request.headers.get('sender')
  >
  > >>> t.apply_async(headers={'sender': 'George Costanza'})
  > ```
- New [`before_task_publish`](../userguide/signals.html#std-signal-before_task_publish) signal dispatched before a task message
  is sent and can be used to modify the final message fields (Issue #1281).
- New [`after_task_publish`](../userguide/signals.html#std-signal-after_task_publish) signal replaces the old [`task_sent`](../userguide/signals.html#std-signal-task_sent)
  signal.

  > The [`task_sent`](../userguide/signals.html#std-signal-task_sent) signal is now deprecated and shouldn’t be used.
- New [`worker_process_shutdown`](../userguide/signals.html#std-signal-worker_process_shutdown) signal is dispatched in the
  prefork pool child processes as they exit.

  > Contributed by Daniel M Taub.
- `celery.platforms.PIDFile` renamed to [`celery.platforms.Pidfile`](../internals/reference/celery.platforms.html#celery.platforms.Pidfile "celery.platforms.Pidfile").
- MongoDB Backend: Can now be configured using a URL:
- MongoDB Backend: No longer using deprecated `pymongo.Connection`.
- MongoDB Backend: Now disables `auto_start_request`.
- MongoDB Backend: Now enables `use_greenlets` when eventlet/gevent is used.
- `subtask()` / `maybe_subtask()` renamed to
  `signature()`/`maybe_signature()`.

  > Aliases still available for backwards compatibility.
- The `correlation_id` message property is now automatically set to the
  id of the task.
- The task message `eta` and `expires` fields now includes timezone
  information.
- All result backends `store_result`/`mark_as_*` methods must now accept
  a `request` keyword argument.
- Events now emit warning if the broken `yajl` library is used.
- The [`celeryd_init`](../userguide/signals.html#std-signal-celeryd_init) signal now takes an extra keyword argument:
  `option`.

  > This is the mapping of parsed command line arguments, and can be used to
  > prepare new preload arguments (`app.user_options['preload']`).
- New callback: [`app.on_configure()`](../reference/celery.html#celery.Celery.on_configure "celery.Celery.on_configure").

  > This callback is called when an app is about to be configured (a
  > configuration key is required).
- Worker: No longer forks on `HUP`.

  > This means that the worker will reuse the same pid for better
  > support with external process supervisors.

- Worker: The log message `Got task from broker …` was changed to
  `Received task …`.
- Worker: The log message `Skipping revoked task …` was changed
  to `Discarding revoked task …`.
- Optimization: Improved performance of `ResultSet.join_native()`.

  > Contributed by Stas Rudakou.
- The [`task_revoked`](../userguide/signals.html#std-signal-task_revoked) signal now accepts new `request` argument
  (Issue #1555).

  > The revoked signal is dispatched after the task request is removed from
  > the stack, so it must instead use the
  > [`Request`](../reference/celery.worker.request.html#celery.worker.request.Request "celery.worker.request.Request") object to get information
  > about the task.
- Worker: New [`-X`](../reference/cli.html#cmdoption-celery-worker-X) command line argument to
  exclude queues (Issue #1399).

  > The [`-X`](../reference/cli.html#cmdoption-celery-worker-X) argument is the inverse of the
  > [`-Q`](../reference/cli.html#cmdoption-celery-worker-Q) argument and accepts a list of queues
  > to exclude (not consume from):
  >
  > ```
  > # Consume from all queues in CELERY_QUEUES, but not the 'foo' queue.
  > $ celery worker -A proj -l info -X foo
  > ```
- Adds `C_FAKEFORK` environment variable for simple
  init-script/**celery multi** debugging.

  > This means that you can now do:
  >
  > ```
  > $ C_FAKEFORK=1 celery multi start 10
  > ```
  >
  > or:
  >
  > ```
  > $ C_FAKEFORK=1 /etc/init.d/celeryd start
  > ```
  >
  > to avoid the daemonization step to see errors that aren’t visible
  > due to missing stdout/stderr.
  >
  > A `dryrun` command has been added to the generic init-script that
  > enables this option.
- New public API to push and pop from the current task stack:

  > `celery.app.push_current_task()` and
  > `` celery.app.pop_current_task`() ``.
- `RetryTaskError` has been renamed to [`Retry`](../reference/celery.exceptions.html#celery.exceptions.Retry "celery.exceptions.Retry").

  > The old name is still available for backwards compatibility.
- New semi-predicate exception [`Reject`](../reference/celery.exceptions.html#celery.exceptions.Reject "celery.exceptions.Reject").

  > This exception can be raised to `reject`/`requeue` the task message,
  > see [Reject](../userguide/tasks.html#task-semipred-reject) for examples.
- [Semipredicates](../userguide/tasks.html#task-semipredicates) documented: (Retry/Ignore/Reject).

## 

- The `BROKER_INSIST` setting and the `insist` argument
  to `~@connection` is no longer supported.
- The `CELERY_AMQP_TASK_RESULT_CONNECTION_MAX` setting is no longer
  supported.

  > Use `BROKER_POOL_LIMIT` instead.
- The `CELERY_TASK_ERROR_WHITELIST` setting is no longer supported.

  > You should set the `ErrorMail` attribute
  > of the task class instead. You can also do this using
  > `CELERY_ANNOTATIONS`:
  >
  > > ```
  > > from celery import Celery
  > > from celery.utils.mail import ErrorMail
  > >
  > > class MyErrorMail(ErrorMail):
  > >     whitelist = (KeyError, ImportError)
  > >
  > >     def should_send(self, context, exc):
  > >         return isinstance(exc, self.whitelist)
  > >
  > > app = Celery()
  > > app.conf.CELERY_ANNOTATIONS = {
  > >     '*': {
  > >         'ErrorMail': MyErrorMails,
  > >     }
  > > }
  > > ```
- Functions that creates a broker connections no longer
  supports the `connect_timeout` argument.

  > This can now only be set using the `BROKER_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT`
  > setting. This is because functions no longer create connections
  > directly, but instead get them from the connection pool.
- The `CELERY_AMQP_TASK_RESULT_EXPIRES` setting is no longer supported.

  > Use `CELERY_TASK_RESULT_EXPIRES` instead.

## 

See the [Celery Deprecation Time-line](../internals/deprecation.html#deprecation-timeline).

## 

- AMQP Backend: join didn’t convert exceptions when using the json
  serializer.
- Non-abstract task classes are now shared between apps (Issue #1150).

  > Note that non-abstract task classes shouldn’t be used in the
  > new API. You should only create custom task classes when you
  > use them as a base class in the `@task` decorator.
  >
  > This fix ensure backwards compatibility with older Celery versions
  > so that non-abstract task classes works even if a module is imported
  > multiple times so that the app is also instantiated multiple times.
- Worker: Workaround for Unicode errors in logs (Issue #427).
- Task methods: `.apply_async` now works properly if args list is None
  (Issue #1459).
- Eventlet/gevent/solo/threads pools now properly handles [`BaseException`](https://docs.python.org/dev/library/exceptions.html#BaseException "(in Python v3.15)")
  errors raised by tasks.
- `autoscale` and `pool_grow`/`pool_shrink` remote
  control commands will now also automatically increase and decrease the
  consumer prefetch count.

  > Fix contributed by Daniel M. Taub.
- `celery control pool_` commands didn’t coerce string arguments to int.
- Redis/Cache chords: Callback result is now set to failure if the group
  disappeared from the database (Issue #1094).
- Worker: Now makes sure that the shutdown process isn’t initiated more
  than once.
- Programs: **celery multi** now properly handles both `-f` and
  [`--logfile`](../reference/cli.html#cmdoption-celery-worker-f) options (Issue #1541).

## 

- Module `celery.task.trace` has been renamed to [`celery.app.trace`](../internals/reference/celery.app.trace.html#module-celery.app.trace "celery.app.trace").
- Module `celery.concurrency.processes` has been renamed to
  [`celery.concurrency.prefork`](../internals/reference/celery.concurrency.prefork.html#module-celery.concurrency.prefork "celery.concurrency.prefork").
- Classes that no longer fall back to using the default app:

  > - Result backends ([`celery.backends.base.BaseBackend`](../internals/reference/celery.backends.base.html#celery.backends.base.BaseBackend "celery.backends.base.BaseBackend"))
  > - [`celery.worker.WorkController`](../reference/celery.worker.html#celery.worker.WorkController "celery.worker.WorkController")
  > - `celery.worker.Consumer`
  > - [`celery.worker.request.Request`](../reference/celery.worker.request.html#celery.worker.request.Request "celery.worker.request.Request")
  >
  > This means that you have to pass a specific app when instantiating
  > these classes.
- `EventDispatcher.copy_buffer` renamed to
  `app.events.Dispatcher.extend_buffer()`.
- Removed unused and never documented global instance
  `celery.events.state.state`.
- `app.events.Receiver` is now a [`kombu.mixins.ConsumerMixin`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/projects/kombu/en/main/reference/kombu.mixins.html#kombu.mixins.ConsumerMixin "(in Kombu v5.6)")
  subclass.
- [`celery.apps.worker.Worker`](../reference/celery.apps.worker.html#celery.apps.worker.Worker "celery.apps.worker.Worker") has been refactored as a subclass of
  [`celery.worker.WorkController`](../reference/celery.worker.html#celery.worker.WorkController "celery.worker.WorkController").

  > This removes a lot of duplicate functionality.
- The `Celery.with_default_connection` method has been removed in favor
  of `with app.connection_or_acquire` ([`app.connection_or_acquire()`](../reference/celery.html#celery.Celery.connection_or_acquire "celery.Celery.connection_or_acquire"))
- The `celery.results.BaseDictBackend` class has been removed and is replaced by
  `celery.results.BaseBackend`.
