# Change history for Celery 1.0

- RabbitMQ 1.8.0 has extended their exchange equivalence tests to
  include auto\_delete and durable. This broke the AMQP backend.

  If you’ve already used the AMQP backend this means you have to
  delete the previous definitions:

  ```
  $ camqadm exchange.delete celeryresults
  ```

  or:

  ```
  $ python manage.py camqadm exchange.delete celeryresults
  ```

### 

- `INT`/`Control`-`c` killed the pool, abruptly terminating the
  currently executing tasks.

  > Fixed by making the pool worker processes ignore `SIGINT`.
- Shouldn’t close the consumers before the pool is terminated, just cancel
  the consumers.

  > See issue #122.
- Now depends on <https://pypi.org/project/billiard/> >= 0.3.1
- worker: Previously exceptions raised by worker components could stall
  start-up, now it correctly logs the exceptions and shuts down.
- worker: Prefetch counts was set too late. QoS is now set as early as possible,
  so the worker: can’t slurp in all the messages at start-up.

### 

- [`celery.contrib.abortable`](../reference/celery.contrib.abortable.html#module-celery.contrib.abortable "celery.contrib.abortable"): Abortable tasks.

  > Tasks that defines steps of execution, the task can then
  > be aborted after each step has completed.
- [`EventDispatcher`](../reference/celery.events.html#celery.events.EventDispatcher "celery.events.EventDispatcher"): No longer creates AMQP channel
  if events are disabled
- Added required RPM package names under [bdist\_rpm] section, to support building RPMs
  from the sources using `setup.py`.
- Running unit tests: `NOSE_VERBOSE` environment var now enables verbose output from Nose.
- `celery.execute.apply()`: Pass log file/log level arguments as task kwargs.

  > See issue #110.
- celery.execute.apply: Should return exception, not
  `ExceptionInfo` on error.

  > See issue #111.
- Added new entries to the [FAQs](../faq.html#faq):

  > - Should I use retry or acks\_late?
  > - Can I call a task by name?

### 

- Messages are now acknowledged *just before* the task function is executed.

  > This is the behavior we’ve wanted all along, but couldn’t have because of
  > limitations in the multiprocessing module.
  > The previous behavior wasn’t good, and the situation worsened with the
  > release of 1.0.1, so this change will definitely improve
  > reliability, performance and operations in general.
  >
  > For more information please see <http://bit.ly/9hom6T>
- Database result backend: result now explicitly sets null=True as
  django-picklefield version 0.1.5 changed the default behavior
  right under our noses :(

  > See: <http://bit.ly/d5OwMr>
  >
  > This means those who created their Celery tables (via `syncdb` or
  > `celeryinit`) with <https://pypi.org/project/django-picklefield`/>
  > versions >= 0.1.5 has to alter their tables to
  > allow the result field to be NULL manually.
  >
  > MySQL:
  >
  > ```
  > ALTER TABLE celery_taskmeta MODIFY result TEXT NULL
  > ```
  >
  > PostgreSQL:
  >
  > ```
  > ALTER TABLE celery_taskmeta ALTER COLUMN result DROP NOT NULL
  > ```
- Removed Task.rate\_limit\_queue\_type, as it wasn’t really useful
  and made it harder to refactor some parts.
- Now depends on carrot >= 0.10.4
- Now depends on billiard >= 0.3.0

### 

- AMQP backend: Added timeout support for result.get() /
  result.wait().
- New task option: Task.acks\_late (default: `CELERY_ACKS_LATE`)

  > Late ack means the task messages will be acknowledged **after** the task
  > has been executed, not *right before*, which is the default behavior.
  >
  > Note
  >
  > This means the tasks may be executed twice if the worker
  > crashes in mid-execution. Not acceptable for most
  > applications, but desirable for others.
- Added Crontab-like scheduling to periodic tasks.

  > Like a cronjob, you can specify units of time of when
  > you’d like the task to execute. While not a full implementation
  > of **cron**’s features, it should provide a fair degree of common scheduling
  > needs.
  >
  > You can specify a minute (0-59), an hour (0-23), and/or a day of the
  > week (0-6 where 0 is Sunday, or by names:
  > `sun, mon, tue, wed, thu, fri, sat`).
  >
  > Examples:
  >
  > ```
  > from celery.schedules import crontab
  > from celery.decorators import periodic_task
  >
  > @periodic_task(run_every=crontab(hour=7, minute=30))
  > def every_morning():
  >     print('Runs every morning at 7:30a.m')
  >
  > @periodic_task(run_every=crontab(hour=7, minute=30, day_of_week='mon'))
  > def every_monday_morning():
  >     print('Run every monday morning at 7:30a.m')
  >
  > @periodic_task(run_every=crontab(minutes=30))
  > def every_hour():
  >     print('Runs every hour on the clock (e.g., 1:30, 2:30, 3:30 etc.).')
  > ```
  >
  > Note
  >
  > This a late addition. While we have unit tests, due to the
  > nature of this feature we haven’t been able to completely test this
  > in practice, so consider this experimental.
- TaskPool.apply\_async: Now supports the accept\_callback argument.
- apply\_async: Now raises [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/dev/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "(in Python v3.15)") if task args isn’t a list,
  or kwargs isn’t a tuple (Issue #95).
- Task.max\_retries can now be None, which means it will retry forever.
- `celerybeat`: Now reuses the same connection when publishing large
  sets of tasks.
- Modified the task locking example in the documentation to use
  cache.add for atomic locking.
- Added experimental support for a *started* status on tasks.

  > If Task.track\_started is enabled the task will report its status
  > as “started” when the task is executed by a worker.
  >
  > The default value is False as the normal behavior is to not
  > report that level of granularity. Tasks are either pending, finished,
  > or waiting to be retried. Having a “started” status can be useful for
  > when there are long running tasks and there’s a need to report which
  > task is currently running.
  >
  > The global default can be overridden by the `CELERY_TRACK_STARTED`
  > setting.
- User Guide: New section Tips and Best Practices.

  > Contributions welcome!

### 

- Remote control commands can now send replies back to the caller.

  > Existing commands has been improved to send replies, and the client
  > interface in celery.task.control has new keyword arguments: reply,
  > timeout and limit. Where reply means it will wait for replies,
  > timeout is the time in seconds to stop waiting for replies, and limit
  > is the maximum number of replies to get.
  >
  > By default, it will wait for as many replies as possible for one second.
  >
  > - rate\_limit(task\_name, destination=all, reply=False, timeout=1, limit=0)

  >   > [{'worker1': True},
  >   >  {'worker2'; True}]
  >   > ```
- You can now add your own remote control commands!

  > Remote control commands are functions registered in the command
  > registry. Registering a command is done using
  > [`celery.worker.control.Panel.register()`](../internals/reference/celery.worker.control.html#celery.worker.control.Panel.register "celery.worker.control.Panel.register"):
  >
  > ```
  > from celery.task.control import Panel
  >
  > @Panel.register
  > def reset_broker_connection(state, **kwargs):
  >     state.consumer.reset_connection()
  >     return {'ok': 'connection re-established'}
  > ```
  >
  > With this module imported in the worker, you can launch the command
  > using celery.task.control.broadcast:
  >
  > ```
  > >>> from celery.task.control import broadcast
  > >>> broadcast('reset_broker_connection', reply=True)
  > [{'worker1': {'ok': 'connection re-established'},
  >  {'worker2': {'ok': 'connection re-established'}}]
  > ```
  >
  > **TIP** You can choose the worker(s) to receive the command
  > by using the destination argument:
  >
  > ```
  > >>> broadcast('reset_broker_connection', destination=['worker1'])
  > [{'worker1': {'ok': 'connection re-established'}]
  > ```
- New remote control command: dump\_reserved

  > Dumps tasks reserved by the worker, waiting to be executed:
  >
  > ```
  > >>> from celery.task.control import broadcast
  > >>> broadcast('dump_reserved', reply=True)
  > [{'myworker1': [<TaskRequest ....>]}]
  > ```
- New remote control command: dump\_schedule

  > Dumps the workers currently registered ETA schedule.
  > These are tasks with an eta (or countdown) argument
  > waiting to be executed by the worker.
  >
  > ```
  > >>> from celery.task.control import broadcast
  > >>> broadcast('dump_schedule', reply=True)
  > [{'w1': []},
  >  {'w3': []},
  >  {'w2': ['0. 2010-05-12 11:06:00 pri0 <TaskRequest

### 

- Mediator thread no longer blocks for more than 1 second.

  > With rate limits enabled and when there was a lot of remaining time,
  > the mediator thread could block shutdown (and potentially block other
  > jobs from coming in).
- Remote rate limits wasn’t properly applied (Issue #98).
- Now handles exceptions with Unicode messages correctly in
  TaskRequest.on\_failure.
- Database backend: TaskMeta.result: default value should be None
  not empty string.

- Deprecated: `CELERY_BACKEND`, please use
  `CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND` instead.
- We now use a custom logger in tasks. This logger supports task magic
  keyword arguments in formats.

  > The default format for tasks (`CELERYD_TASK_LOG_FORMAT`) now
  > includes the id and the name of tasks so the origin of task log messages
  > can easily be traced.
  >
  > Example output::
  > :   [2010-03-25 13:11:20,317: INFO/PoolWorker-1]
  >     :   [tasks.add(a6e1c5ad-60d9-42a0-8b24-9e39363125a4)] Hello from add
  >
  > To revert to the previous behavior you can set:
  >
  > ```
  > CELERYD_TASK_LOG_FORMAT = """
  >     [%(asctime)s: %(levelname)s/%(processName)s] %(message)s
  > """.strip()
  > ```
- Unit tests: Don’t disable the django test database tear down,
  instead fixed the underlying issue which was caused by modifications
  to the DATABASE\_NAME setting (Issue #82).
- Django Loader: New config `CELERY_DB_REUSE_MAX` (max number of
  tasks to reuse the same database connection)

  > The default is to use a new connection for every task.
  > We’d very much like to reuse the connection, but a safe number of
  > reuses isn’t known, and we don’t have any way to handle the errors
  > that might happen, which may even be database dependent.
  >
  > See: <http://bit.ly/94fwdd>
- worker: The worker components are now configurable: `CELERYD_POOL`,
  `CELERYD_CONSUMER`, `CELERYD_MEDIATOR`, and
  `CELERYD_ETA_SCHEDULER`.

  > The default configuration is as follows:
  >
  > ```
  > CELERYD_POOL = 'celery.concurrency.processes.TaskPool'
  > CELERYD_MEDIATOR = 'celery.worker.controllers.Mediator'
  > CELERYD_ETA_SCHEDULER = 'celery.worker.controllers.ScheduleController'
  > CELERYD_CONSUMER = 'celery.worker.consumer.Consumer'
  > ```
  >
  > The `CELERYD_POOL` setting makes it easy to swap out the
  > multiprocessing pool with a threaded pool, or how about a
  > twisted/eventlet pool?
  >
  > Consider the competition for the first pool plug-in started!
- Debian init-scripts: Use -a not && (Issue #82).
- Debian init-scripts: Now always preserves $CELERYD\_OPTS from the
  /etc/default/celeryd and /etc/default/celerybeat.
- celery.beat.Scheduler: Fixed a bug where the schedule wasn’t properly
  flushed to disk if the schedule hadn’t been properly initialized.
- `celerybeat`: Now syncs the schedule to disk when receiving the `SIGTERM`
  and `SIGINT` signals.
- Control commands: Make sure keywords arguments aren’t in Unicode.
- ETA scheduler: Was missing a logger object, so the scheduler crashed
  when trying to log that a task had been revoked.
- `management.commands.camqadm`: Fixed typo camqpadm -> camqadm
  (Issue #83).
- PeriodicTask.delta\_resolution: wasn’t working for days and hours, now fixed
  by rounding to the nearest day/hour.
- Fixed a potential infinite loop in BaseAsyncResult.\_\_eq\_\_, although
  there’s no evidence that it has ever been triggered.
- worker: Now handles messages with encoding problems by acking them and
  emitting an error message.

- Tasks are now acknowledged early instead of late.

  > This is done because messages can only be acknowledged within the same

  > re-fetch the message again to acknowledge it.
  >
  > This might or might not affect you, but mostly those running tasks with a
  > really long execution time are affected, as all tasks that’s made it
  > all the way into the pool needs to be executed before the worker can
  > safely terminate (this is at most the number of pool workers, multiplied
  > by the `CELERYD_PREFETCH_MULTIPLIER` setting).
  >
  > We multiply the prefetch count by default to increase the performance at

  > A patch to [`multiprocessing`](https://docs.python.org/dev/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing "(in Python v3.15)") is currently being

- The worker now shutdowns cleanly when receiving the `SIGTERM` signal.
- The worker now does a cold shutdown if the `SIGINT` signal
  is received (`Control`-`c`),
  this means it tries to terminate as soon as possible.
- Caching of results now moved to the base backend classes, so no need
  to implement this functionality in the base classes.
- Caches are now also limited in size, so their memory usage doesn’t grow
  out of control.

  > You can set the maximum number of results the cache
  > can hold using the `CELERY_MAX_CACHED_RESULTS` setting (the
  > default is five thousand results). In addition, you can re-fetch already
  > retrieved results using backend.reload\_task\_result +
  > backend.reload\_taskset\_result (that’s for those who want to send
  > results incrementally).
- The worker now works on Windows again.

  > Warning
  >
  > If you’re using Celery with Django, you can’t use project.settings
  > as the settings module name, but the following should work:
  >
  > ```
  > $ python manage.py celeryd --settings=settings
  > ```
- Execution: .messaging.TaskPublisher.send\_task now
  incorporates all the functionality apply\_async previously did.

  > Like converting countdowns to ETA, so `celery.execute.apply_async()` is
  > now simply a convenient front-end to
  > `celery.messaging.TaskPublisher.send_task()`, using
  > the task classes default options.
  >
  > Also `celery.execute.send_task()` has been
  > introduced, which can apply tasks using just the task name (useful
  > if the client doesn’t have the destination task in its task registry).
  >
  > Example:
  >
  > ```
  > >>> from celery.execute import send_task
  > >>> result = send_task('celery.ping', args=[], kwargs={})
  > >>> result.get()
  > 'pong'
  > ```
- camqadm: This is a new utility for command-line access to the AMQP API.

  > Excellent for deleting queues/bindings/exchanges, experimentation and
  > testing:
  >
  > ```
  > $ camqadm
  > 1> help
  > ```
  >
  > Gives an interactive shell, type help for a list of commands.
  >
  > When using Django, use the management command instead:
  >
  > ```
  > $ python manage.py camqadm
  > 1> help
  > ```
- Redis result backend: To conform to recent Redis API changes, the following
  settings has been deprecated:

  > > - REDIS\_TIMEOUT
  > > - REDIS\_CONNECT\_RETRY
  >
  > These will emit a DeprecationWarning if used.
  >
  > A REDIS\_PASSWORD setting has been added, so you can use the new
  > simple authentication mechanism in Redis.
- The redis result backend no longer calls SAVE when disconnecting,
  as this is apparently better handled by Redis itself.
- If settings.DEBUG is on, the worker now warns about the possible
  memory leak it can result in.
- The ETA scheduler now sleeps at most two seconds between iterations.
- The ETA scheduler now deletes any revoked tasks it might encounter.

  > As revokes aren’t yet persistent, this is done to make sure the task
  > is revoked even though, for example, it’s currently being hold because
  > its ETA is a week into the future.
- The task\_id argument is now respected even if the task is executed
  eagerly (either using apply, or `CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER`).
- The internal queues are now cleared if the connection is reset.
- New magic keyword argument: delivery\_info.

  > Used by retry() to resend the task to its original destination using the same
  > exchange/routing\_key.
- Events: Fields wasn’t passed by .send() (fixes the UUID key errors
  in celerymon)
- Added –schedule/-s option to the worker, so it is possible to
  specify a custom schedule filename when using an embedded `celerybeat`
  server (the -B/–beat) option.
- Better Python 2.4 compatibility. The test suite now passes.
- task decorators: Now preserve docstring as cls.\_\_doc\_\_, (was previously
  copied to cls.run.\_\_doc\_\_)
- The testproj directory has been renamed to tests and we’re now using
  nose + django-nose for test discovery, and unittest2 for test
  cases.
- New pip requirements files available in `requirements`.
- TaskPublisher: Declarations are now done once (per process).
- Added Task.delivery\_mode and the `CELERY_DEFAULT_DELIVERY_MODE`
  setting.

  > These can be used to mark messages non-persistent (i.e., so they’re
  > lost if the broker is restarted).
- Now have our own ImproperlyConfigured exception, instead of using the
  Django one.
- Improvements to the Debian init-scripts: Shows an error if the program is
  not executable. Does not modify CELERYD when using django with
  virtualenv.

### 

- Celery doesn’t support detaching anymore, so you have to use the tools
  available on your platform, or something like <https://pypi.org/project/supervisor/> to make
  `celeryd`/`celerybeat`/`celerymon` into background processes.

  > We’ve had too many problems with the worker daemonizing itself, so it was

  >
  >   > extra/supervisord/supervisord.conf
  >
  > In addition to –detach, the following program arguments has been
  > removed: –uid, –gid, –workdir, –chroot, –pidfile,
  > –umask. All good daemonization tools should support equivalent
  > functionality, so don’t worry.
  >
  > Also the following configuration keys has been removed:
  > CELERYD\_PID\_FILE, CELERYBEAT\_PID\_FILE, CELERYMON\_PID\_FILE.
- Default worker loglevel is now WARN, to enable the previous log level
  start the worker with –loglevel=INFO.
- Tasks are automatically registered.

  > This means you no longer have to register your tasks manually.
  > You don’t have to change your old code right away, as it doesn’t matter if
  > a task is registered twice.
  >
  > If you don’t want your task to be automatically registered you can set
  > the abstract attribute
  >
  > ```
  > class MyTask(Task):
  >     abstract = True
  > ```
  >
  > By using abstract only tasks subclassing this task will be automatically
  > registered (this works like the Django ORM).
  >
  > If you don’t want subclasses to be registered either, you can set the
  > autoregister attribute to False.
  >
  > Incidentally, this change also fixes the problems with automatic name
  > assignment and relative imports. So you also don’t have to specify a task name
  > anymore if you use relative imports.
- You can no longer use regular functions as tasks.

  > This change was added
  > because it makes the internals a lot more clean and simple. However, you can
  > now turn functions into tasks by using the @task decorator:
  >
  > ```
  > from celery.decorators import task
  >

  >     return x + y
  > ```
  >
  > See also
  >
  > [Tasks](../userguide/tasks.html#guide-tasks) for more information about the task decorators.
- The periodic task system has been rewritten to a centralized solution.

  > This means the worker no longer schedules periodic tasks by default,
  > but a new daemon has been introduced: celerybeat.
  >
  > To launch the periodic task scheduler you have to run `celerybeat`:
  >
  > ```
  > $ celerybeat
  > ```
  >
  > Make sure this is running on one server only, if you run it twice, all
  > periodic tasks will also be executed twice.
  >
  > If you only have one worker server you can embed it into the worker like this:
  >
  > ```
  > $ celeryd --beat # Embed celerybeat in celeryd.
  > ```
- The supervisor has been removed.

  > This means the -S and –supervised options to celeryd is
  > no longer supported. Please use something like <http://supervisord.org>
  > instead.
- TaskSet.join has been removed, use TaskSetResult.join instead.
- The task status “DONE” has been renamed to “SUCCESS”.
- AsyncResult.is\_done has been removed, use AsyncResult.successful
  instead.
- The worker no longer stores errors if Task.ignore\_result is set, to
  revert to the previous behavior set
  `CELERY_STORE_ERRORS_EVEN_IF_IGNORED` to True.
- The statistics functionality has been removed in favor of events,
  so the -S and –statistics` switches has been removed.
- The module celery.task.strategy has been removed.
- celery.discovery has been removed, and it’s `autodiscover` function is
  now in celery.loaders.djangoapp. Reason: Internal API.
- The `CELERY_LOADER` environment variable now needs loader class name
  in addition to module name,

  > For example, where you previously had: “celery.loaders.default”, you now
  > need “celery.loaders.default.Loader”, using the previous syntax will result
  > in a DeprecationWarning.
- Detecting the loader is now lazy, and so isn’t done when importing
  celery.loaders.

  > To make this happen celery.loaders.settings has
  > been renamed to load\_settings and is now a function returning the
  > settings object. celery.loaders.current\_loader is now also
  > a function, returning the current loader.

  > ```
  > loader = current_loader
  > ```
  >

### 

- The following configuration variables has been renamed and will be
  deprecated in v2.0:

  > - `CELERYD_DAEMON_LOG_FORMAT` -> `CELERYD_LOG_FORMAT`
  > - `CELERYD_DAEMON_LOG_LEVEL` -> `CELERYD_LOG_LEVEL`
  > - `CELERY_AMQP_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT` -> `CELERY_BROKER_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT`
  > - `CELERY_AMQP_CONNECTION_RETRY` -> `CELERY_BROKER_CONNECTION_RETRY`
  > - `CELERY_AMQP_CONNECTION_MAX_RETRIES` -> `CELERY_BROKER_CONNECTION_MAX_RETRIES`
  > - `SEND_CELERY_TASK_ERROR_EMAILS` -> `CELERY_SEND_TASK_ERROR_EMAILS`
- The public API names in celery.conf has also changed to a consistent naming
  scheme.
- We now support consuming from an arbitrary number of queues.

  > To do this we had to rename the configuration syntax. If you use any of
  > the custom AMQP routing options (queue/exchange/routing\_key, etc.), you
  > should read the new FAQ entry: [Can I send some tasks to only some servers?](../faq.html#faq-task-routing).

- TaskSet.run has been renamed to TaskSet.apply\_async.

  > TaskSet.run has now been deprecated, and is scheduled for

### 

- Rate limiting support (per task type, or globally).
- New periodic task system.
- Automatic registration.
- New cool task decorator syntax.
- worker: now sends events if enabled with the -E argument.

  > Excellent for monitoring tools, one is already in the making
  > (<https://github.com/celery/celerymon>).
  >
  > Current events include: [`worker-heartbeat`](../userguide/monitoring.html#std-event-worker-heartbeat),
  > task-[received/succeeded/failed/retried],
  > [`worker-online`](../userguide/monitoring.html#std-event-worker-online), [`worker-offline`](../userguide/monitoring.html#std-event-worker-offline).
- You can now delete (revoke) tasks that’s already been applied.
- You can now set the hostname the worker identifies as using the –hostname
  argument.
- Cache backend now respects the `CELERY_TASK_RESULT_EXPIRES` setting.
- Message format has been standardized and now uses ISO-8601 format
  for dates instead of datetime.
- worker now responds to the `SIGHUP` signal by restarting itself.
- Periodic tasks are now scheduled on the clock.

  > That is, timedelta(hours=1) means every hour at :00 minutes, not every
  > hour from the server starts. To revert to the previous behavior you
  > can set PeriodicTask.relative = True.
- Now supports passing execute options to a TaskSets list of args.

  > Example:
  >
  > ```
  > >>> ts = TaskSet(add, [([2, 2], {}, {'countdown': 1}),
  > ...                    ([4, 4], {}, {'countdown': 2}),
  > ...                    ([8, 8], {}, {'countdown': 3})])
  > >>> ts.run()
  > ```
- Got a 3x performance gain by setting the prefetch count to four times the
  concurrency, (from an average task round-trip of 0.1s to 0.03s!).

  > A new setting has been added: `CELERYD_PREFETCH_MULTIPLIER`, which
  > is set to 4 by default.
- Improved support for webhook tasks.

  > celery.task.rest is now deprecated, replaced with the new and shiny
  > celery.task.http. With more reflective names, sensible interface,
  > and it’s possible to override the methods used to perform HTTP requests.
- The results of task sets are now cached by storing it in the result
  backend.

### 

- Now depends on <https://pypi.org/project/carrot/> >= 0.8.1
- New dependencies: <https://pypi.org/project/billiard/>, <https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/>,
  <https://pypi.org/project/django-picklefield/>.
- No longer depends on python-daemon
- The uuid distribution is added as a dependency when running Python 2.4.
- Now remembers the previously detected loader by keeping it in
  the `CELERY_LOADER` environment variable.

  > This may help on windows where fork emulation is used.
- ETA no longer sends datetime objects, but uses ISO 8601 date format in a
  string for better compatibility with other platforms.
- No longer sends error mails for retried tasks.
- Task can now override the backend used to store results.
- Refactored the ExecuteWrapper, apply and `CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER`
  now also executes the task callbacks and signals.
- Now using a proper scheduler for the tasks with an ETA.

  > This means waiting ETA tasks are sorted by time, so we don’t have
  > to poll the whole list all the time.
- Now also imports modules listed in `CELERY_IMPORTS` when running
  with django (as documented).
- Log level for stdout/stderr changed from INFO to ERROR
- ImportErrors are now properly propagated when auto-discovering tasks.
- You can now use celery.messaging.establish\_connection to establish a
  connection to the broker.
- When running as a separate service the periodic task scheduler does some
  smart moves to not poll too regularly.

  > If you need faster poll times you can lower the value
  > of `CELERYBEAT_MAX_LOOP_INTERVAL`.
- You can now change periodic task intervals at runtime, by making
  run\_every a property, or subclassing PeriodicTask.is\_due.
- The worker now supports control commands enabled through the use of a
  broadcast queue, you can remotely revoke tasks or set the rate limit for
  a task type. See `celery.task.control`.
- The services now sets informative process names (as shown in ps
  listings) if the <https://pypi.org/project/setproctitle/> module is installed.
- [`NotRegistered`](../reference/celery.exceptions.html#celery.exceptions.NotRegistered "celery.exceptions.NotRegistered") now inherits from [`KeyError`](https://docs.python.org/dev/library/exceptions.html#KeyError "(in Python v3.15)"),
  and TaskRegistry.\_\_getitem\_\_`+`pop raises NotRegistered instead
- You can set the loader via the `CELERY_LOADER` environment variable.
- You can now set `CELERY_IGNORE_RESULT` to ignore task results by
  default (if enabled, tasks doesn’t save results or errors to the backend used).
- The worker now correctly handles malformed messages by throwing away and
  acknowledging the message, instead of crashing.

### 

- Fixed a race condition that could happen while storing task results in the
  database.

### 

- Reference now split into two sections; API reference and internal module
  reference.

- Now emits a warning if the –detach argument is used.
  –detach shouldn’t be used anymore, as it has several not easily fixed
  bugs related to it. Instead, use something like start-stop-daemon,
  <https://pypi.org/project/supervisor/> or **launchd** (macOS).
- Make sure logger class is process aware, even if running Python >= 2.6.
- Error emails are not sent anymore when the task is retried.

### 

This release (with carrot 0.8.0) enables AMQP QoS (quality of service), which
means the workers will only receive as many messages as it can handle at a
time. As with any release, you should test this version upgrade on your
development servers before rolling it out to production!

### 

- If you’re using Python < 2.6 and you use the multiprocessing backport, then
  multiprocessing version 2.6.2.1 is required.
- All AMQP\_\* settings has been renamed to BROKER\_\*, and in addition
  AMQP\_SERVER has been renamed to BROKER\_HOST, so before where you had:

  ```
  AMQP_SERVER = 'localhost'
  AMQP_PORT = 5678
  AMQP_USER = 'myuser'
  AMQP_PASSWORD = 'mypassword'
  AMQP_VHOST = 'celery'
  ```

  You need to change that to:

  ```
  BROKER_HOST = 'localhost'
  BROKER_PORT = 5678
  BROKER_USER = 'myuser'
  BROKER_PASSWORD = 'mypassword'
  BROKER_VHOST = 'celery'
  ```
- Custom carrot backends now need to include the backend class name, so before
  where you had:

  ```
  CARROT_BACKEND = 'mycustom.backend.module'
  ```

  you need to change it to:

  ```
  CARROT_BACKEND = 'mycustom.backend.module.Backend'
  ```

  where Backend is the class name. This is probably “Backend”, as
  that was the previously implied name.
- New version requirement for carrot: 0.8.0

### 

- Incorporated the multiprocessing backport patch that fixes the
  processName error.
- Ignore the result of PeriodicTask’s by default.
- Added a Redis result store backend
- Allow `/etc/default/celeryd` to define additional options
  for the `celeryd` init-script.
- MongoDB periodic tasks issue when using different time than UTC fixed.
- Windows specific: Negate test for available `os.fork`
  (thanks [@miracle2k](https://github.com/miracle2k/)).
- Now tried to handle broken PID files.
- Added a Django test runner to contrib that sets
  CELERY\_ALWAYS\_EAGER = True for testing with the database backend.
- Added a `CELERY_CACHE_BACKEND` setting for using something other
  than the Django-global cache backend.
- Use custom implementation of `functools.partial` for Python 2.4 support
  (Probably still problems with running on 2.4, but it will eventually be
  supported)
- Prepare exception to pickle when saving [`RETRY`](../userguide/tasks.html#std-state-RETRY) status for all backends.
- SQLite no concurrency limit should only be effective if the database backend
  is used.

### 

- Add traceback to result value on failure.

  > Note
  >
  > If you use the database backend you have to re-create the
  > database table celery\_taskmeta.
  >
  > Contact the mailing-list or irc-channel channel
  > for help doing this.
- Database tables are now only created if the database backend is used,
  so if you change back to the database backend at some point,
  be sure to initialize tables (django: syncdb, python: celeryinit).

  Note

  This is only applies if using Django version 1.1 or higher.
- Now depends on carrot version 0.6.0.
- Now depends on python-daemon 1.4.8

### 

- Celery can now be used in pure Python (outside of a Django project).

  > This means Celery is no longer Django specific.
  >
  > For more information see the FAQ entry
  > [Is Celery for Django only?](../faq.html#faq-is-celery-for-django-only).
- Celery now supports task retries.

  > See [Retrying](../userguide/tasks.html#task-retry) for more information.
- We now have an AMQP result store backend.

  > It uses messages to publish task return value and status. And it’s
  > incredibly fast!
  >
  > See issue #6 for more info!
- AMQP QoS (prefetch count) implemented:

  > This to not receive more messages than we can handle.
- Now redirects stdout/stderr to the workers log file when detached
- Now uses inspect.getargspec to only pass default arguments
  :   the task supports.
- Add Task.on\_success, .on\_retry, .on\_failure handlers
  :   See `celery.task.base.Task.on_success()`,
      :   `celery.task.base.Task.on_retry()`,
          `celery.task.base.Task.on_failure()`,
- celery.utils.gen\_unique\_id: Workaround for
  :   <http://bugs.python.org/issue4607>
- You can now customize what happens at worker start, at process init, etc.,
  :   by creating your own loaders (see [`celery.loaders.default`](../reference/celery.loaders.default.html#module-celery.loaders.default "celery.loaders.default"),
      `celery.loaders.djangoapp`, [`celery.loaders`](../reference/celery.loaders.html#module-celery.loaders "celery.loaders")).
- Support for multiple AMQP exchanges and queues.

  > This feature misses documentation and tests, so anyone interested
  > is encouraged to improve this situation.
- The worker now survives a restart of the AMQP server!

  Automatically re-establish AMQP broker connection if it’s lost.

  New settings:

  > - AMQP\_CONNECTION\_RETRY
  >   :   Set to True to enable connection retries.
  > - AMQP\_CONNECTION\_MAX\_RETRIES.
  >   :   Maximum number of restarts before we give up. Default: 100.

### 

- Fix an incompatibility between python-daemon and multiprocessing,
  :   which resulted in the [Errno 10] No child processes problem when
      detaching.
- Fixed a possible DjangoUnicodeDecodeError being raised when saving pickled
  :   data to Django`s Memcached cache backend.
- Better Windows compatibility.
- New version of the pickled field (taken from
  :   <http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/513/>)
- New signals introduced: task\_sent, task\_prerun and
  :   task\_postrun, see [`celery.signals`](../reference/celery.signals.html#module-celery.signals "celery.signals") for more information.
- TaskSetResult.join caused TypeError when timeout=None.
  :   Thanks Jerzy Kozera. Closes #31
- views.apply should return HttpResponse instance.
  :   Thanks to Jerzy Kozera. Closes #32
- PeriodicTask: Save conversion of run\_every from int
  :   to timedelta to the class attribute instead of on the instance.
- Exceptions has been moved to celery.exceptions, but are still
  :   available in the previous module.
- Try to rollback transaction and retry saving result if an error happens
  :   while setting task status with the database backend.
- jail() refactored into `celery.execute.ExecuteWrapper`.
- views.apply now correctly sets mime-type to “application/json”
- views.task\_status now returns exception if state is [`RETRY`](../userguide/tasks.html#std-state-RETRY)
- views.task\_status now returns traceback if state is [`FAILURE`](../userguide/tasks.html#std-state-FAILURE)
  :   or [`RETRY`](../userguide/tasks.html#std-state-RETRY)
- Documented default task arguments.
- Add a sensible \_\_repr\_\_ to ExceptionInfo for easier debugging
- Fix documentation typo .. import map -> .. import dmap.

### 

- Fixed a bug where tasks raising unpickleable exceptions crashed pool
  :   workers. So if you’ve had pool workers mysteriously disappearing, or
      problems with the worker stopping working, this has been fixed in this
      version.
- Fixed a race condition with periodic tasks.
- The task pool is now supervised, so if a pool worker crashes,
  :   goes away or stops responding, it is automatically replaced with
      a new one.
- Task.name is now automatically generated out of class module+name, for
  example “djangotwitter.tasks.UpdateStatusesTask”. Very convenient.
  No idea why we didn’t do this before. Some documentation is updated to not
  manually specify a task name.

### 

- Tested with Django 1.1
- New Tutorial: Creating a click counter using Carrot and Celery
- Database entries for periodic tasks are now created at the workers
  :   start-up instead of for each check (which has been a forgotten TODO/XXX
      in the code for a long time)
- New settings variable: `CELERY_TASK_RESULT_EXPIRES`
  :   Time (in seconds, or a datetime.timedelta object) for when after
      stored task results are deleted. For the moment this only works for the
      database backend.
- The worker now emits a debug log message for which periodic tasks
  :   has been launched.
- The periodic task table is now locked for reading while getting
  :   periodic task status (MySQL only so far, seeking patches for other
      engines)
- A lot more debugging information is now available by turning on the
  :   DEBUG log level (–loglevel=DEBUG).
- Functions/methods with a timeout argument now works correctly.
- New: celery.strategy.even\_time\_distribution:
  :   With an iterator yielding task args, kwargs tuples, evenly distribute
      the processing of its tasks throughout the time window available.
- Log message Unknown task ignored… now has log level ERROR
- Log message when task is received is now emitted for all tasks, even if
  :   the task has an ETA (estimated time of arrival). Also the log message now
      includes the ETA for the task (if any).
- Acknowledgment now happens in the pool callback. Can’t do ack in the job
  :   target, as it’s not pickleable (can’t share AMQP connection, etc.).
- Added note about .delay hanging in README
- Tests now passing in Django 1.1
- Fixed discovery to make sure app is in INSTALLED\_APPS
- Previously overridden pool behavior (process reap, wait until pool worker
  :   available, etc.) is now handled by multiprocessing.Pool itself.
- Convert statistics data to Unicode for use as kwargs. Thanks Lucy!

- Adds eager execution. celery.execute.apply`|`Task.apply executes the
  function blocking until the task is done, for API compatibility it
  returns a celery.result.EagerResult instance. You can configure
  Celery to always run tasks locally by setting the
  `CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER` setting to True.
- Now depends on anyjson.

- New arguments to apply\_async (the advanced version of
  delay\_task), countdown and eta;

  ```
  >>> # Run 10 seconds into the future.
  >>> res = apply_async(MyTask, countdown=10);
  ```

  ```
  >>> # Run 1 day from now
  >>> res = apply_async(MyTask,
  ...                   eta=datetime.now() + timedelta(days=1))
  ```
- Now unlinks stale PID files
- Lots of more tests.
- Now compatible with carrot >= 0.5.0.
- **IMPORTANT** The subtask\_ids attribute on the TaskSetResult
  instance has been removed. To get this information instead use:

  ```
  >>> subtask_ids = [subtask.id for subtask in ts_res.subtasks]
  ```
- Taskset.run() now respects extra message options from the task class.
- Task: Add attribute ignore\_result: Don’t store the status and
  return value. This means you can’t use the
  celery.result.AsyncResult to check if the task is
  done, or get its return value. Only use if you need the performance
  and is able live without these features. Any exceptions raised will
  store the return value/status as usual.
- Task: Add attribute disable\_error\_emails to disable sending error
  emails for that task.
- Should now work on Windows (although running in the background won’t
  work, so using the –detach argument results in an exception
  being raised).
- Added support for statistics for profiling and monitoring.
  To start sending statistics start the worker with the
  –statistics option. Then after a while you can dump the results
  by running `python manage.py celerystats. See
  celery.monitoring for more information.
- The Celery daemon can now be supervised (i.e., it is automatically
  restarted if it crashes). To use this start the worker with the
  –supervised` option (or alternatively -S).
- views.apply: View calling a task.

  > Example:
  >
  > ```
  > http://e.com/celery/apply/task_name/arg1/arg2//?kwarg1=a&kwarg2=b
  > ```
  >
  > Warning
  >
  > Use with caution! Don’t expose this URL to the public
  > without first ensuring that your code is safe!
- Refactored celery.task. It’s now split into three modules:

  > - `celery.task`
  >
  >   > Contains apply\_async, delay\_task, discard\_all, and task
  >   > shortcuts, plus imports objects from celery.task.base and
  >   > celery.task.builtins
  > - `celery.task.base`
  >
  >   > Contains task base classes: Task, PeriodicTask,
  >   > TaskSet, AsynchronousMapTask, ExecuteRemoteTask.
  > - `celery.task.builtins`
  >
  >   > Built-in tasks: PingTask, DeleteExpiredTaskMetaTask.

- **IMPORTANT** Now uses AMQP`s basic.consume instead of
  basic.get. This means we’re no longer polling the broker for
  new messages.
- **IMPORTANT** Default concurrency limit is now set to the number of CPUs
  available on the system.
- **IMPORTANT** tasks.register: Renamed task\_name argument to
  name, so:

  ```
  >>> tasks.register(func, task_name='mytask')
  ```

  has to be replaced with:

  ```
  >>> tasks.register(func, name='mytask')
  ```
- The daemon now correctly runs if the pidfile is stale.
- Now compatible with carrot 0.4.5
- Default AMQP connection timeout is now 4 seconds.
- AsyncResult.read() was always returning True.
- Only use README as long\_description if the file exists so easy\_install
  doesn’t break.
- celery.view: JSON responses now properly set its mime-type.
- apply\_async now has a connection keyword argument so you
  can re-use the same AMQP connection if you want to execute
  more than one task.
- Handle failures in task\_status view such that it won’t throw 500s.
- Fixed typo AMQP\_SERVER in documentation to AMQP\_HOST.
- Worker exception emails sent to administrators now works properly.
- No longer depends on django, so installing celery won’t affect
  the preferred Django version installed.
- Now works with PostgreSQL (<https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/>) again by registering the
  PickledObject field.
- Worker: Added –detach option as an alias to –daemon, and
  it’s the term used in the documentation from now on.
- Make sure the pool and periodic task worker thread is terminated
  properly at exit (so `Control`-`c` works again).
- Now depends on python-daemon.
- Removed dependency to simplejson
- Cache Backend: Re-establishes connection for every task process
  if the Django cache backend is <https://pypi.org/project/python-memcached/>/<https://pypi.org/project/libmemcached/>.
- Tyrant Backend: Now re-establishes the connection for every task
  executed.

Warning

This is a development version, for the stable release, please
see versions 0.2.x.

**VERY IMPORTANT:** Pickle is now the encoder used for serializing task
arguments, so be sure to flush your task queue before you upgrade.

- **IMPORTANT** TaskSet.run() now returns a `celery.result.TaskSetResult`
  instance, which lets you inspect the status and return values of a
  taskset as it was a single entity.
- **IMPORTANT** Celery now depends on carrot >= 0.4.1.
- The Celery daemon now sends task errors to the registered admin emails.
  To turn off this feature, set SEND\_CELERY\_TASK\_ERROR\_EMAILS to
  False in your settings.py. Thanks to Grégoire Cachet.
- You can now run the Celery daemon by using manage.py:

  ```
  $ python manage.py celeryd
  ```

  Thanks to Grégoire Cachet.
- Added support for message priorities, topic exchanges, custom routing
  keys for tasks. This means we’ve introduced
  celery.task.apply\_async, a new way of executing tasks.

  You can use celery.task.delay and celery.Task.delay like usual, but
  if you want greater control over the message sent, you want
  celery.task.apply\_async and celery.Task.apply\_async.

  This also means the AMQP configuration has changed. Some settings has
  been renamed, while others are new:

  > - `CELERY_AMQP_EXCHANGE`
  > - `CELERY_AMQP_PUBLISHER_ROUTING_KEY`
  > - `CELERY_AMQP_CONSUMER_ROUTING_KEY`
  > - `CELERY_AMQP_CONSUMER_QUEUE`
  > - `CELERY_AMQP_EXCHANGE_TYPE`

  See the entry [Can I send some tasks to only some servers?](../faq.html#faq-task-routing) in the
  [FAQ](../faq.html#faq) for more information.
- Task errors are now logged using log level ERROR instead of INFO,
  and stack-traces are dumped. Thanks to Grégoire Cachet.
- Make every new worker process re-establish it’s Django DB connection,
  this solving the “MySQL connection died?” exceptions.
  Thanks to Vitaly Babiy and Jirka Vejrazka.
- **IMPORTANT** Now using pickle to encode task arguments. This means you
  now can pass complex Python objects to tasks as arguments.
- Removed dependency to yadayada.
- Added a FAQ, see docs/faq.rst.
- Now converts any Unicode keys in task kwargs to regular strings.
  Thanks Vitaly Babiy.
- Renamed the TaskDaemon to WorkController.
- celery.datastructures.TaskProcessQueue is now renamed to
  celery.pool.TaskPool.
- The pool algorithm has been refactored for greater performance and

- *Internal release*. Improved handling of unpickleable exceptions,
  get\_result now tries to recreate something looking like the
  original exception.

- It’s getting quite stable, with a lot of new features, so bump
  version to 0.2. This is a pre-release.
- celery.task.mark\_as\_read() and celery.task.mark\_as\_failure() has
  been removed. Use celery.backends.default\_backend.mark\_as\_read(),
  and celery.backends.default\_backend.mark\_as\_failure() instead.

- Forgot to add yadayada to install requirements.
- Now deletes all expired task results, not just those marked as done.
- Able to load the Tokyo Tyrant backend class without django
  configuration, can specify tyrant settings directly in the class
  constructor.
- Improved API documentation
- Now using the Sphinx documentation system, you can build
  the html documentation by doing:

  > ```
  > $ cd docs
  > $ make html
  > ```

  and the result will be in docs/\_build/html.

- delay\_task() etc. now returns celery.task.AsyncResult object,
  which lets you check the result and any failure that might’ve
  happened. It kind of works like the multiprocessing.AsyncResult
  class returned by multiprocessing.Pool.map\_async.
- Added `dmap()` and `dmap_async()`. This works like the
  multiprocessing.Pool versions except they’re tasks
  distributed to the Celery server. Example:

  > ```
  > >>> from celery.task import dmap
  > >>> import operator
  > >>> dmap(operator.add, [[2, 2], [4, 4], [8, 8]])
  > >>> [4, 8, 16]
  >
  > >>> from celery.task import dmap_async
  > >>> import operator
  > >>> result = dmap_async(operator.add, [[2, 2], [4, 4], [8, 8]])
  > >>> result.ready()
  > False
  > >>> time.sleep(1)
  > >>> result.ready()
  > True
  > >>> result.result
  > [4, 8, 16]
  > ```
- Refactored the task meta-data cache and database backends, and added
  a new backend for Tokyo Tyrant. You can set the backend in your django
  settings file.

  > Example:
  >
  > ```
  > CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = 'database'; # Uses the database
  > CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = 'cache'; # Uses the django cache framework
  > CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = 'tyrant'; # Uses Tokyo Tyrant
  > TT_HOST = 'localhost'; # Hostname for the Tokyo Tyrant server.
  > TT_PORT = 6657; # Port of the Tokyo Tyrant server.
  > ```

  settings.CELERY\_AMQP\_EXCHANGE, settings.CELERY\_AMQP\_ROUTING\_KEY,
  and settings.CELERY\_AMQP\_CONSUMER\_QUEUE.

- Introducing TaskSet. A set of subtasks is executed and you can
  find out how many, or if all them, are done (excellent for progress
  bars and such)
- Now catches all exceptions when running Task.\_\_call\_\_, so the
  daemon doesn’t die. This doesn’t happen for pure functions yet, only
  Task classes.
- autodiscover() now works with zipped eggs.
- Worker: Now adds current working directory to sys.path for
  convenience.
- The run\_every attribute of PeriodicTask classes can now be a
  datetime.timedelta() object.
- Worker: You can now set the DJANGO\_PROJECT\_DIR variable
  for the worker and it will add that to sys.path for easy launching.
- Can now check if a task has been executed or not via HTTP.
- You can do this by including the Celery urls.py into your project,

  ```
  >>> url(r'^celery/$', include('celery.urls'))
  ```

  then visiting the following URL:

  ```
  http://mysite/celery/$task_id/done/
  ```

  this will return a JSON dictionary, for example:

  ```
  {"task": {"id": "TASK_ID", "executed": true}}
  ```
- delay\_task now returns string id, not uuid.UUID instance.
- Now has PeriodicTasks, to have cron like functionality.
- Project changed name from crunchy to celery. The details of
  the name change request is in docs/name\_change\_request.txt.

- Initial release

Sphinx started sucking by removing images from \_static, so we need to add
them here into actual content to ensure they are included :-(
