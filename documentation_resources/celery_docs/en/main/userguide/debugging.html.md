# Debugging

## Debugging Tasks Remotely (using pdb)

### Basics

[`celery.contrib.rdb`](../reference/celery.contrib.rdb.html#module-celery.contrib.rdb "celery.contrib.rdb") is an extended version of [`pdb`](https://docs.python.org/dev/library/pdb.html#module-pdb "(in Python v3.15)") that
enables remote debugging of processes that doesn’t have terminal
access.

Example usage:

```
from celery import task
from celery.contrib import rdb

@task()
def add(x, y):
    result = x + y
    rdb.set_trace()  # <- set break-point
    return result
```

[`set_trace()`](../reference/celery.contrib.rdb.html#celery.contrib.rdb.set_trace "celery.contrib.rdb.set_trace") sets a break-point at the current
location and creates a socket you can telnet into to remotely debug
your task.

The debugger may be started by multiple processes at the same time,
so rather than using a fixed port the debugger will search for an
available port, starting from the base port (6900 by default).
The base port can be changed using the environment variable
[`CELERY_RDB_PORT`](../reference/celery.contrib.rdb.html#envvar-CELERY_RDB_PORT).

By default the debugger will only be available from the local host,
to enable access from the outside you have to set the environment
variable [`CELERY_RDB_HOST`](../reference/celery.contrib.rdb.html#envvar-CELERY_RDB_HOST).

When the worker encounters your break-point it’ll log the following
information:

```
[INFO/MainProcess] Received task:
    tasks.add[d7261c71-4962-47e5-b342-2448bedd20e8]
[WARNING/PoolWorker-1] Remote Debugger:6900:
    Please telnet 127.0.0.1 6900.  Type `exit` in session to continue.
[2011-01-18 14:25:44,119: WARNING/PoolWorker-1] Remote Debugger:6900:
    Waiting for client...
```

If you telnet the port specified you’ll be presented
with a pdb shell:

```
$ telnet localhost 6900
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
> /opt/devel/demoapp/tasks.py(128)add()
-> return result
(Pdb)
```

Enter `help` to get a list of available commands,
It may be a good idea to read the [Python Debugger Manual](http://docs.python.org/library/pdb.html) if
you have never used pdb before.

To demonstrate, we’ll read the value of the `result` variable,
change it and continue execution of the task:

```
(Pdb) result
4
(Pdb) result = 'hello from rdb'
(Pdb) continue
Connection closed by foreign host.
```

The result of our vandalism can be seen in the worker logs:

```
[2011-01-18 14:35:36,599: INFO/MainProcess] Task
    tasks.add[d7261c71-4962-47e5-b342-2448bedd20e8] succeeded
    in 61.481s: 'hello from rdb'
```

### Tips

#### Enabling the break-point signal

If the environment variable `CELERY_RDBSIG` is set, the worker
will open up an rdb instance whenever the SIGUSR2 signal is sent.
This is the case for both main and worker processes.

For example starting the worker with:

```
$ CELERY_RDBSIG=1 celery worker -l INFO
```

You can start an rdb session for any of the worker processes by executing:

```
$ kill -USR2 <pid>
```
