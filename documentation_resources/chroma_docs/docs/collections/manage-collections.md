Chroma lets you manage collections of embeddings, using the **collection** primitive. Collections are the fundamental unit of storage and querying in Chroma.

## [​](#creating-collections) Creating Collections

Chroma collections are created with a name. Collection names are used in the url, so there are a few restrictions on them:

- The length of the name must be between 3 and 512 characters.
- The name must start and end with a lowercase letter or a digit, and it can contain dots, dashes, and underscores in between.
- The name must not contain two consecutive dots.
- The name must not be a valid IP address.

Rust

```
collection = client.create_collection(name="my_collection")
```

Note that collection names must be **unique** inside a Chroma database. If you try to create a collection with a name of an existing one, you will see an exception.

### [​](#embedding-functions) Embedding Functions

When you add documents to a collection, Chroma will embed them for you by using the collection’s **embedding function**. Chroma will use [sentence transformer](https://www.sbert.net/index.html) embedding function as a default.
Chroma also offers various embedding function, which you can provide upon creating a collection. For example, you can create a collection using the `OpenAIEmbeddingFunction`:

- Python
- TypeScript
- Rust

Install the `openai` package:

pip

poetry

uv

Create your collection with the `OpenAIEmbeddingFunction`:

```
import os
from chromadb.utils.embedding_functions import OpenAIEmbeddingFunction

collection = client.create_collection(
    name="my_collection",
    embedding_function=OpenAIEmbeddingFunction(
        api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
        model_name="text-embedding-3-small"
    )
)
```

Instead of having Chroma embed documents, you can also provide embeddings directly when [adding data](./add-data) to a collection. In this case, your collection will not have an embedding function set, and you will be responsible for providing embeddings directly when adding data and querying.

The Rust client expects embeddings to be provided directly when using `add`, `get`, `search` and other functions. Use your provider SDK to generate embeddings, then pass them to Chroma.

    vec!["id1".to_string(), "id2".to_string(), "id3".to_string()],
    vec![

        vec![4.5, 6.9, 4.4],
        vec![1.1, 2.3, 3.2],
    ],
    Some(vec![
        Some("lorem ipsum...".to_string()),
        Some("doc2".to_string()),
        Some("doc3".to_string()),
    ]),
    None,
    None,
).await?;
```

### [​](#collection-metadata) Collection Metadata

When creating collections, you can pass the optional `metadata` argument to add a mapping of metadata key-value pairs to your collections. This can be useful for adding general about the collection like creation time, description of the data stored in the collection, and more.

Python

TypeScript

Rust

```
from datetime import datetime

collection = client.create_collection(
    name="my_collection",
    embedding_function=emb_fn,
    metadata={
        "description": "my first Chroma collection",
        "created": str(datetime.now())
    }
)
```

## [​](#getting-collections) Getting Collections

- Python
- TypeScript
- Rust

There are several ways to get a collection after it was created.The `get_collection` function will get a collection from Chroma by name. It returns a `Collection` object with `name`, `metadata`, `configuration`, and `embedding_function`.

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
collection = client.get_collection(name="my-collection")
```

The `get_or_create_collection` function behaves similarly, but will create the collection if it doesn’t exist. You can pass to it the same arguments `create_collection` expects, and the client will ignore them if the collection already exists.

Copy

Ask AI

```
collection = client.get_or_create_collection(
    name="my-collection",
    metadata={"description": "..."}
)
```

The `list_collections` function returns the collections you have in your Chroma database. The collections will be ordered by creation time from oldest to newest.

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
collections = client.list_collections()
```

By default, `list_collections` returns up to 100 collections. If you have more than 100 collections, or need to get only a subset of your collections, you can use the `limit` and `offset` arguments:

Copy

Ask AI

```
first_collections_batch = client.list_collections(limit=100) # get the first 100 collections
second_collections_batch = client.list_collections(limit=100, offset=100) # get the next 100 collections
collections_subset = client.list_collections(limit=20, offset=50) # get 20 collections starting from the 50th
```

Current versions of Chroma store the embedding function you used to create a collection on the server, so the client can resolve it for you on subsequent “get” operations. If you are running an older version of the Chroma client or server (earlier than 1.1.13), you will need to provide the same embedding function you used to create a collection when using `get_collection`:

There are several ways to get a collection after it was created.The `getCollection` function will get a collection from Chroma by name. It returns a collection object with `name`, `metadata`, `configuration`, and `embeddingFunction`. If you did not provide an embedding function to `createCollection`, you can provide it to `getCollection`.

```
const collection = await client.getCollection({ name: "my-collection " });

The `getOrCreate` function behaves similarly, but will create the collection if it doesn’t exist. You can pass to it the same arguments `createCollection` expects, and the client will ignore them if the collection already exists.

Current versions of Chroma store the embedding function you used to create a collection on the server, so the client can resolve it for you on subsequent “get” operations. If you are running an older version of the Chroma JS/TS client (earlier than 3.04) or server (earlier than 1.1.13), you will need to provide the same embedding function you used to create a collection when using `getCollection` and `getCollections`:

  { name: "col2", embeddingFunction: defaultEF },
]);
