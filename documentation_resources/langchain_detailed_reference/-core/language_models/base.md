## Classes

[class

BaseCache

Interface for a caching layer for LLMs and Chat models.

The cache interface consists of the following methods:

- lookup: Look up a value based on a prompt and `llm_string`.
- update: Update the cache based on a prompt and `llm_string`.
- clear: Clear the cache.

In addition, the cache interface provides an async version of each method.

The default implementation of the async methods is to run the synchronous
method in an executor. It's recommended to override the async methods
and provide async implementations to avoid unnecessary overhead.](/python/langchain-core/caches/BaseCache)[class

AIMessage

Message from an AI.

An `AIMessage` is returned from a chat model as a response to a prompt.

This message represents the output of the model and consists of both
the raw output as returned by the model and standardized fields
(e.g., tool calls, usage metadata) added by the LangChain framework.](/python/langchain-core/messages/ai/AIMessage)[class

BaseMessage

Base abstract message class.

Messages are the inputs and outputs of a chat model.

Examples include [`HumanMessage`](/python/langchain-core/messages/human/HumanMessage),
[`AIMessage`](/python/langchain-core/messages/ai/AIMessage), and
[`SystemMessage`](/python/langchain-core/messages/system/SystemMessage).](/python/langchain-core/messages/base/BaseMessage)[class

ChatPromptValueConcrete

Chat prompt value which explicitly lists out the message types it accepts.

For use in external schemas.](/python/langchain-core/prompt_values/ChatPromptValueConcrete)[class

PromptValue

Base abstract class for inputs to any language model.

`PromptValues` can be converted to both LLM (pure text-generation) inputs and
chat model inputs.](/python/langchain-core/prompt_values/PromptValue)[class

StringPromptValue

String prompt value.](/python/langchain-core/prompt_values/StringPromptValue)[class

Runnable

A unit of work that can be invoked, batched, streamed, transformed and composed.

# Key Methods

- `invoke`/`ainvoke`: Transforms a single input into an output.
- `batch`/`abatch`: Efficiently transforms multiple inputs into outputs.
- `stream`/`astream`: Streams output from a single input as it's produced.
- `astream_log`: Streams output and selected intermediate results from an
  input.

Built-in optimizations:

- **Batch**: By default, batch runs invoke() in parallel using a thread pool
  executor. Override to optimize batching.
- **Async**: Methods with `'a'` prefix are asynchronous. By default, they execute
  the sync counterpart using asyncio's thread pool.
  Override for native async.

All methods accept an optional config argument, which can be used to configure
execution, add tags and metadata for tracing and debugging etc.

Runnables expose schematic information about their input, output and config via
the `input_schema` property, the `output_schema` property and `config_schema`
method.

# Composition

Runnable objects can be composed together to create chains in a declarative way.

Any chain constructed this way will automatically have sync, async, batch, and
streaming support.

The main composition primitives are `RunnableSequence` and `RunnableParallel`.

**`RunnableSequence`** invokes a series of runnables sequentially, with
one Runnable's output serving as the next's input. Construct using
the `|` operator or by passing a list of runnables to `RunnableSequence`.

**`RunnableParallel`** invokes runnables concurrently, providing the same input
to each. Construct it using a dict literal within a sequence or by passing a
dict to `RunnableParallel`.

For example,

```
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda

# A RunnableSequence constructed using the `|` operator
sequence = RunnableLambda(lambda x: x + 1) | RunnableLambda(lambda x: x * 2)
sequence.invoke(1)  # 4
sequence.batch([1, 2, 3])  # [4, 6, 8]

# A sequence that contains a RunnableParallel constructed using a dict literal
sequence = RunnableLambda(lambda x: x + 1) | {
    "mul_2": RunnableLambda(lambda x: x * 2),
    "mul_5": RunnableLambda(lambda x: x * 5),
}
sequence.invoke(1)  # {'mul_2': 4, 'mul_5': 10}
```

# Standard Methods

All `Runnable`s expose additional methods that can be used to modify their
behavior (e.g., add a retry policy, add lifecycle listeners, make them
configurable, etc.).

These methods will work on any `Runnable`, including `Runnable` chains
constructed by composing other `Runnable`s.
See the individual methods for details.

For example,

```
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda

import random

def add_one(x: int) -> int:
    return x + 1

def buggy_double(y: int) -> int:
    """Buggy code that will fail 70% of the time"""
    if random.random() > 0.3:
        print('This code failed, and will probably be retried!')  # noqa: T201
        raise ValueError('Triggered buggy code')
    return y * 2

sequence = (
    RunnableLambda(add_one) |
    RunnableLambda(buggy_double).with_retry( # Retry on failure
        stop_after_attempt=10,
        wait_exponential_jitter=False
    )
)

print(sequence.input_schema.model_json_schema()) # Show inferred input schema
print(sequence.output_schema.model_json_schema()) # Show inferred output schema
print(sequence.invoke(2)) # invoke the sequence (note the retry above!!)
```

# Debugging and tracing

As the chains get longer, it can be useful to be able to see intermediate results
to debug and trace the chain.

You can set the global debug flag to True to enable debug output for all chains:

```
from langchain_core.globals import set_debug

set_debug(True)
```

Alternatively, you can pass existing or custom callbacks to any given chain:

```
from langchain_core.tracers import ConsoleCallbackHandler

chain.invoke(..., config={"callbacks": [ConsoleCallbackHandler()]})
```

RunnableSerializable

Runnable that can be serialized to JSON.](/python/langchain-core/runnables/base/RunnableSerializable)[class

LLMResult

A container for results of an LLM call.

Both chat models and LLMs generate an `LLMResult` object. This object contains the
generated outputs and any additional information that the model provider wants to
return.](/python/langchain-core/outputs/llm_result/LLMResult)[class
