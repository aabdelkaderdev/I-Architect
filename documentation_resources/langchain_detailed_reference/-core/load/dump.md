# dump

Serialize LangChain objects to JSON.

Provides `dumps` (to JSON string) and `dumpd` (to dict) for serializing
`Serializable` objects.

## Escaping

During serialization, plain dicts (user data) that contain an `'lc'` key are escaped
by wrapping them: `{"__lc_escaped__": {...original...}}`. This prevents injection
attacks where malicious data could trick the deserializer into instantiating
arbitrary classes. The escape marker is removed during deserialization.

This is an allowlist approach: only dicts explicitly produced by
`Serializable.to_json()` are treated as LC objects; everything else is escaped if it
could be confused with the LC format.

## Classes

[class

Serializable

Serializable base class.

This class is used to serialize objects to JSON.

It relies on the following methods and properties:

- [`is_lc_serializable`](/python/langchain-core/load/serializable/Serializable/is_lc_serializable): Is this class serializable?

  By design, even if a class inherits from `Serializable`, it is not serializable
  by default. This is to prevent accidental serialization of objects that should
  not be serialized.
- [`get_lc_namespace`](/python/langchain-core/load/serializable/Serializable/get_lc_namespace): Get the namespace of the LangChain object.

  During deserialization, this namespace is used to identify
  the correct class to instantiate.

  Please see the `Reviver` class in `langchain_core.load.load` for more details.

  During deserialization an additional mapping is handle classes that have moved
  or been renamed across package versions.
- [`lc_secrets`](/python/langchain-core/load/serializable/Serializable/lc_secrets): A map of constructor argument names to secret ids.
- [`lc_attributes`](/python/langchain-core/load/serializable/Serializable/lc_attributes): List of additional attribute names that should be included
  as part of the serialized representation.](/python/langchain-core/load/serializable/Serializable)[class

AIMessage

Message from an AI.

An `AIMessage` is returned from a chat model as a response to a prompt.

This message represents the output of the model and consists of both
the raw output as returned by the model and standardized fields
(e.g., tool calls, usage metadata) added by the LangChain framework.](/python/langchain-core/messages/ai/AIMessage)[class

ChatGeneration

A single chat generation output.

A subclass of `Generation` that represents the response from a chat model that
generates chat messages.

The `message` attribute is a structured representation of the chat message. Most of
the time, the message will be of type `AIMessage`.

Users working with chat models will usually access information via either
`AIMessage` (returned from runnable interfaces) or `LLMResult` (available via
callbacks).](/python/langchain-core/outputs/chat_generation/ChatGeneration)
