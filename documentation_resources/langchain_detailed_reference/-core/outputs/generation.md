Generation output schema.

## Functions

[function

merge\_dicts

Merge dictionaries.

Merge many dicts, handling specific scenarios where a key exists in both
dictionaries but has a value of `None` in `'left'`. In such cases, the method uses
the value from `'right'` for that key in the merged dictionary.](/python/langchain-core/utils/_merge/merge_dicts)

## Classes

[class

Serializable

Serializable base class.

This class is used to serialize objects to JSON.

It relies on the following methods and properties:

- [`is_lc_serializable`](/python/langchain-core/load/serializable/Serializable/is_lc_serializable): Is this class serializable?

  By design, even if a class inherits from `Serializable`, it is not serializable
  by default. This is to prevent accidental serialization of objects that should
  not be serialized.
- [`get_lc_namespace`](/python/langchain-core/load/serializable/Serializable/get_lc_namespace): Get the namespace of the LangChain object.

  During deserialization, this namespace is used to identify
  the correct class to instantiate.

  Please see the `Reviver` class in `langchain_core.load.load` for more details.

  During deserialization an additional mapping is handle classes that have moved
  or been renamed across package versions.
- [`lc_secrets`](/python/langchain-core/load/serializable/Serializable/lc_secrets): A map of constructor argument names to secret ids.
- [`lc_attributes`](/python/langchain-core/load/serializable/Serializable/lc_attributes): List of additional attribute names that should be included
  as part of the serialized representation.](/python/langchain-core/load/serializable/Serializable)[class

Generation

A single text generation output.

Generation represents the response from an "old-fashioned" LLM (string-in,
string-out) that generates regular text (not chat messages).

This model is used internally by chat model and will eventually be mapped to a more
general `LLMResult` object, and then projected into an `AIMessage` object.

LangChain users working with chat models will usually access information via
`AIMessage` (returned from runnable interfaces) or `LLMResult` (available via
callbacks). Please refer to `AIMessage` and `LLMResult` for more information.](/python/langchain-core/outputs/generation/Generation)[class

GenerationChunk

`GenerationChunk`, which can be concatenated with other `Generation` chunks.](/python/langchain-core/outputs/generation/GenerationChunk)
